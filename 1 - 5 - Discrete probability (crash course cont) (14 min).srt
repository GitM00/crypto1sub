00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,540
这一节，我们继续讨论离散概率的应用
In this segment, we're gonna continue with
a few more tools from discrete

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:07,468
再提醒一下，如果想了解这方面更多
probability, and I want to remind everyone
that if you wanna read more about this,

3
00:00:07,468 --> 00:00:11,521
请参考维基百科的这个链接
there's more information in wiki books
article that is linked over here. So first

4
00:00:11,521 --> 00:00:16,446
我们先回顾一下相关知识
我们说离散概率总是
let's do a quick recap of where we are. We
said that the discrete probability is

5
00:00:16,446 --> 00:00:21,496
定义在有限集上的，这个集合我们记为U
always defined over a finite set, which
we're gonna denote by U, and typically for

6
00:00:21,496 --> 00:00:26,671
典型的，U是全体N位二进制字符串的集合
us, U is going to be the set of all N bit
binary strings, which we denote by zero

7
00:00:26,671 --> 00:00:31,534
我们记为｛0,1｝^N。现在U上的概率分布P
one to N. Now a probability distribution P
over this universe U is basically a

8
00:00:31,534 --> 00:00:36,834
为全局U中的每个元素赋予权重
function that assigns to every element in
the universe a weight in the interval zero

9
00:00:36,834 --> 00:00:42,196
权重从0到1，如果我们把各元素的权重加起来
to one, such that if we sum the weight of
all these elements, the sum basically sums

10
00:00:42,196 --> 00:00:47,210
答案是1.我们把全局的子集称为事件
up to one. Now we have said that subset of
the universe is what called an event, and

11
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:52,021
我们说事件的概率是其所有元素的权重和
we said that probability of an event is
basically the sum of all the weights of

12
00:00:52,021 --> 00:00:57,073
我们还说事件的概率是某个实数
all the elements in the event and we said
that probability of an event is some real

13
00:00:57,073 --> 00:01:01,764
介于0和1之间。我还要提醒大家
numbers in the interval zero to one. And I
would remind everyone the basically

14
00:01:01,764 --> 00:01:06,575
整个全局的概率是1，事实上
probability of the entire universe is
basically the one by the fact that sum of

15
00:01:06,575 --> 00:01:11,268
所有权重加一块是1
然后我们定义了随机变量是什么
all the weights sums up to one. Then we
define what a random variable is. Formally,

16
00:01:11,268 --> 00:01:15,908
形式上，随机变量是一个从全局
到其他集合的函数
a random variable is a, is a function from
the universe of some other sets. But the

17
00:01:15,908 --> 00:01:20,773
我希望大家记住随机变量从
thing that I want you to remember is that
the random variable takes, values in some

18
00:01:20,773 --> 00:01:25,289
某集合v中取值。事实上随机变量定义了
集合v上的概率分布
set v And, in fact, the random variable
defines the distribution on this set v. So

19
00:01:25,289 --> 00:01:29,651
下一个我们需要的概念是独立性
我将简单定义一下这个概念
the next concept we need is what's called
independence. And I'm gonna very briefly

20
00:01:29,651 --> 00:01:34,278
如果你想了解更多关于独立性的知识
define this. If you want to read more about
independence, please go ahead and look at

21
00:01:34,278 --> 00:01:38,374
去读维基百科的文章吧。本质上
我们说事件A和B互相独立
the wiki books article. But essentially we
say that two events A and B are

22
00:01:38,374 --> 00:01:42,932
当你知道事件A发生的话
independent of one another if When you
know that event A happens, that tells you

23
00:01:42,932 --> 00:01:47,377
这并没有告诉你事件B有没有发生。形式化地
nothing about whether event B actually
happened or not. Formally, the way we

24
00:01:47,377 --> 00:01:52,236
我们这样定义独立性
A和B的概率，或者说
define independence is to say that, the
probability of A and B, namely, that both

25
00:01:52,236 --> 00:01:56,621
两事件同时发生的概率等于
事件A的概率乘以B的概率
events happened, is actually=to the
probability of event A the probability of

26
00:01:56,621 --> 00:02:01,539
所以用乘法来表示概率的联结
event B. So multiplication, in some sense,
the fact that probabilities multiply under

27
00:02:01,539 --> 00:02:06,339
反映了事件的独立性。我说过
conjunction, captures the fact that these
events are independent. And as I said, if

28
00:02:06,339 --> 00:02:11,080
如果你想了解更多，请看看相关材料
you wanna read more about that, please
take a look at the background material.

29
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:16,636
现在同样的道理可以应用在随机变量上
Now the same thing can be said for random
variables. So suppose we have two random

30
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:21,921
设有两随机变量x和y。它们从集合v中取值
variables x and y. They take values in
some set v. Then we say that these random

31
00:02:21,921 --> 00:02:26,868
我们说这些随机变量相互独立
如果概率P(x=a,y=b)
variables are independent if the
probability that x = a, and y = b is equal

32
00:02:26,868 --> 00:02:32,492
等于两概率乘积P(x=a)P(y=b)
这意味着，即使你知道x=a
to the product of these two probabilities.
Basically what this means is, even if you

33
00:02:32,492 --> 00:02:37,606
你也一点不知道y的值。好的
know that x = a, that tells you nothing
about the value of y. Okay, that, that's

34
00:02:37,606 --> 00:02:43,060
这就是乘法的意义
这个随机变量的乘法
what this multiplication means. And again
this needs to hold for all A and B in the

35
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:48,185
对空间中所有a和b恒成立
那么，又要运用大家的记忆力了
space of values of these random variables
So, just again to job your memory. If

36
00:02:48,185 --> 00:02:53,112
大家之前是否见过这个例子？
you've seen this before, a very quick
example. Suppose we look at the, set of,

37
00:02:53,112 --> 00:02:58,171
我们看2位字符串的集合，即00，01，10，11
of two bit strings. So, zero, zero, zero,
one, one zero and, one, one. And suppose we

38
00:02:58,171 --> 00:03:03,625
我们从中随机选择。好，我们
从这四个元素中随机选一个
choose a random, from this set. Okay so we
randomly choose one of these four elements

39
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:08,431
以均匀的概率。现在我们定义两个随机变量
with equal probability. Now let's define
two random variables. X is gonna be the

40
00:03:08,431 --> 00:03:13,541
X是选中字符串的最低位，Y则是最高位
least significant bit that was generated,
and Y is gonna be the most significant bit

41
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:18,981
我声称，随机变量X和Y是相互独立的
generated. So I claim that, these random
variables, x and y, are independent of one

42
00:03:18,981 --> 00:03:23,880
直观地看，随机均匀地选择r
another. And the way to see that
intuitively, is to realize that choosing r

43
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:29,440
四选一基本上跟抛掷硬币一致
uniformly, from the set of four elements
is basically the same as flipping a coin

44
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:37,051
抛掷均匀硬币两次。第一位对应
第一次抛掷结果
An unbiased coin twice. The first bit
corresponds to the outcome of the first

45
00:03:37,051 --> 00:03:38,517
第二位对应第二次抛掷结果
flip and the second bit corresponds to the
outcome of the second flip. And of course

46
00:03:38,517 --> 00:03:43,197
当然共有四种结果。四种结果等可能出现
there are four possible outcomes. All four
outcomes are equally likely which is why

47
00:03:43,197 --> 00:03:47,821
这也是为什么我们取2位字符串上的均匀分布
现在我们看X和Y的独立性
we get the uniform distributions over two
bit strings. Now our variables X and Y. Y

48
00:03:47,821 --> 00:03:52,557
如果我们告诉大家第一次抛掷结果
the independents. Basically if I tell you
result of the first flip namely I tell you

49
00:03:52,557 --> 00:03:57,181
也就是R的最低位。那么我告诉大家
the least signify bit of R. So I tell you
how the first coin you know whether it

50
00:03:57,181 --> 00:04:01,804
第一次抛出正面还是背面
你是无法得知第二次的结果的
fell on its head or fell on its tails.
That tells you nothing about the result of

51
00:04:01,804 --> 00:04:06,844
直观地，你可能觉得这些随机变量
the second flip. Which is why intuitively,
you might, you might expect these random

52
00:04:06,844 --> 00:04:11,624
是相互独立的。但形式上讲
variables to be independent of one
another. But formally, we would have to

53
00:04:11,624 --> 00:04:16,142
我们需要证明之，对所以0，1配对成立
x=0,y=0；x=1,y=1等等
prove that, for, all 01 pairs, the
probability of, x=0 and y=0, x=1, y=1, and

54
00:04:16,142 --> 00:04:21,446
这些概率是满足乘法性质的
我们做一个配对为例
so on. These probabilities multiply. Let's
just do it for one of these pairs. So

55
00:04:21,446 --> 00:04:26,721
我们看x=0,y=0的概率
let's look at the probability that x is =
to zero, and y is = to zero. Well, you see

56
00:04:26,721 --> 00:04:31,027
x=0,y=0的概率就是
that the probability that x is equal to
zero and y is equal to zero is basically

57
00:04:31,027 --> 00:04:35,387
随机变量r=(0,0)的概率
那r=(0,0)的概率是多少？
the probability that r is equal to zero,
zero. And what's the probability that r is

58
00:04:35,387 --> 00:04:39,535
根据均匀分布，这个概率等于1/4
equal to zero, zero? Well, by the uniform
distribution, that's basically equal to

59
00:04:39,535 --> 00:04:44,327
也就是1除以全局大小，这里是1/4
one-fourth. What it's one over size of the
set which is one fourth in this case. And

60
00:04:44,327 --> 00:04:49,095
注意这些概率满足乘法性质
well low and behold that's in fact these
provabilities multiply. Because

61
00:04:49,095 --> 00:04:53,583
X等于0的概率
again the probability that X is equal to
zero. The probability that least significant

62
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:57,566
R的最低位等于0的概率
这个概率严格等于1/2
bit of R is equal to zero. This
probability is exactly one half because

63
00:04:57,566 --> 00:05:01,941
因为只有两个元素的最低位是0
there is exactly two elements that have
their, least significant bit equals to zero.

64
00:05:01,941 --> 00:05:06,373
四选二的概率是1/2，类似地
Two out of four elements gives you a
probability of one half. And similarly the

65
00:05:06,373 --> 00:05:10,738
Y等于0的概率也是1/2
所以实际上概率满足乘法
probability that Y is equal to zero is
also one half so in fact the probability

66
00:05:10,738 --> 00:05:16,434
好的，这就是独立的概念
我之所以想告诉大家这个
multiplies. Okay, so that's, this concept
of independence And the reason I wanted to

67
00:05:16,434 --> 00:05:21,892
是因为我们要看一个异或的重要性质
show you that is because we're gonna look
at an, an important property of XOR that

68
00:05:21,892 --> 00:05:27,349
这个性质我们将反复用到
在讨论异或之前，我们简单回顾一下
we're gonna use again and again. So before
we talk about XOR, let me just do a very

69
00:05:27,349 --> 00:05:32,408
异或是什么。当然
异或就是两位的和
quick review of what XOR is. So, of
course, XOR of two bits means the addition

70
00:05:32,408 --> 00:05:38,065
并取模2。为保证大家都能明白
of those bits, modular two. So just a
kind of, make sure everybody's on the same

71
00:05:38,065 --> 00:05:43,233
如果我们有两位，00，01，10，11
它们的异或的真值表
page. If we have two bits, so 00, 01, ten and
eleven. Their XOR or the truth table of

72
00:05:43,233 --> 00:05:48,106
就是的模2和。可以看到，1+1=2
the XOR is basically just the addition
modular two. As you can see, one+1 is= to

73
00:05:48,106 --> 00:05:52,978
模2后得0。所以这就是异或的真值表
two, modular two. That's=to zero. So this
is the truth table for an XOR. And

74
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:57,665
我总是使用圈和里面的加号来表示异或
I'm always going to denote XOR by the
circle with a + inside. And then when I

75
00:05:57,665 --> 00:06:02,353
当我想应用异或操作时，我逐位使用模2加法
wanna apply XOR to bit strings, I apply
the, addition modular two operation,

76
00:06:02,538 --> 00:06:07,472
例如，这两个字符串的异或是110
bitwise. So, for example, the XOR of these
two strings would be, 110, and I guess

77
00:06:07,472 --> 00:06:12,283
大家补完剩余的异或结果
确保大家明白了
I'll let you fill out the rest of the
XORs, just to make sure we're all on the

78
00:06:12,283 --> 00:06:18,941
当然结果是1101
same page. So of course is comes out to
one, one zero one. Now, we're gonna be

79
00:06:18,941 --> 00:06:23,092
本课程需要做大量的异或
事实上有一个经典的笑话
doing a lot of XORing in this class. In
fact, there's a classical joke that the

80
00:06:23,092 --> 00:06:27,669
密码学家只会玩异或
only think cryptographers know how to do
is just XOR things together. But I want to

81
00:06:27,669 --> 00:06:31,607
我想解释一下为什么密码学里异或如此常见
explain to you why we see XOR so
frequently in cryptography. Basically, XOR

82
00:06:31,607 --> 00:06:35,865
异或具有如下重要性质
has a very important property, and the
property is the following. Suppose we have

83
00:06:35,865 --> 00:06:40,630
假设我们有随机变量y
随机分布于｛0，1｝^n
a random variable y. That's distributed
arbitrarily over 01 to the n. So we know

84
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:45,773
我们不知道y的概率分布
假设我们有另一独立的随机变量x
nothing about the distribution of y. But
now, suppose we have an independent random

85
00:06:45,773 --> 00:06:50,790
在｛0，1｝^n上均匀分布
variable that happens to be uniformly
distributed also over 01 to the n. So it's

86
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:55,766
x是均匀分布很重要，而且x与y独立
very important that x is uniform and is
independent of y. So now let's define the

87
00:06:55,766 --> 00:07:00,851
我们定义随机变量为x和y的异或
然后我宣称
random variable which is the XOR of x and
y. Then I claim that no matter what

88
00:07:00,851 --> 00:07:05,937
无论y如何分布，z总是均匀分布的随机变量
distribution y started with, this z is
always going to be a uniform, random

89
00:07:05,937 --> 00:07:11,287
换句话说，如果我取一含恶意的分布
variable. So in other words if I take an
arbitrarily malicious distribution and I

90
00:07:11,287 --> 00:07:16,373
然后我用一个均匀分布的随机变量异或它
结果得到的是均匀分布的随机变量
XOR with independent uniform random
variable what I end up with is a uniform

91
00:07:16,373 --> 00:07:20,672
这又是一个重要性质
random variable. Okay and this again is
kind of a key property that makes XOR

92
00:07:20,672 --> 00:07:24,490
使得异或在密码中非常有用。这一点
其实非常容易证明
very useful for crypto. So this is
actually a very simple factor to prove,

93
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:28,851
我们直接证明之。我先证n=1的情况
let's just go ahead and do it, let's just
prove it for one bit so for n = one. Okay,

94
00:07:28,851 --> 00:07:33,472
我们写出各个随机变量的概率分布
so the way we'll do it is we'll basically
write out the probability distributions

95
00:07:33,472 --> 00:07:38,242
对应随机变量y
for the various random variables. So let's
see, for the random variable y. Well, the

96
00:07:38,242 --> 00:07:43,167
这个随机变量可以是0或1
我们设它等于0的概率是P0
random variable can be either zero or one.
And let's say that P0 is the probability

97
00:07:43,167 --> 00:07:47,320
等于1的概率是P1
that it's = to zero, and P1 is the
probability that it's =to one. Okay, so

98
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:52,008
这时我们的一个表。类似地
对随机变量x我们也有一个表
that's one of our tables. Similarly, we're
gonna have a table for the variable x.

99
00:07:52,008 --> 00:07:56,458
x的分布更为简单，它是均匀分布
Well, the variable x is much easier.
That's a uniform random variable. So the

100
00:07:56,458 --> 00:08:00,909
所以x等于0的概率是1/2
probability that it's=to zero is exactly
one half The probability that's it's=to

101
00:08:00,909 --> 00:08:05,428
等于1的概率也是1/2
现在我们写出联合分布的概率
one is also exactly one half. Now, let's
write out the probabilities for the join

102
00:08:05,428 --> 00:08:09,599
换句话说，我们要看y和x的组合的概率
distribution. In, in other words, let's
see what the probability, is for the

103
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:14,099
比如说，y=0且x=0的可能性有多大
various, joint values of y and x. In other
words, how likely is, it that y is zero,

104
00:08:14,099 --> 00:08:18,435
y=0且x=1，y=1且x=0，还有(1,1)
and x is zero. Y is zero, and x is one. Y
is one and x is zero, and eleven. Well, so

105
00:08:18,435 --> 00:08:22,770
因为我们假设变量之间相互独立
what we do is, basically, because we
assume the variables are independent, all

106
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:26,518
我们只要算概率乘积即可
we have to do is multiply the
probabilities. So The probability that y

107
00:08:26,518 --> 00:08:30,552
那么y=0的概率是P0
x=0的概率是1/2
is equal to zero is p zero. Probability
that x is equal to zero is one-half. So

108
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:36,843
所以00的概率就是P0/2，类似地
the proximity that, we get 00 as exactly p
zero over two. Similarly for zero one

109
00:08:36,843 --> 00:08:42,387
(0,1)是P0/2，(1,0)是P1/2
we'll get p zero over two, for one zero
we'll get p one over two. And for 1-1,

110
00:08:42,387 --> 00:08:47,232
(1,1)，也就是y=1，且x=1
again, the probability that y is=to one,
and x is=to one, Well, that's P1  the

111
00:08:47,232 --> 00:08:52,347
其概率是P1/2，对吧？
probability that x is=to one, which is a
half, so it's P1 over two. Okay? So those

112
00:08:52,347 --> 00:08:57,664
所以那些是x和y的四种情况的概率
are the four, probabilities for the
various options for x and y. So now, let's

113
00:08:57,664 --> 00:09:03,182
我们来分析，z等于0的概率是多少？
analyze, what is the probability that z is
equal to zero? Well, the probability that

114
00:09:03,182 --> 00:09:08,768
z等于0的概率等于。。我们这样写
z is=to zero is basically the same as the
probability that, let's write it this way,

115
00:09:08,768 --> 00:09:15,342
(x,y)=(0,0)或(1,1)的概率
那些是z为0的两种可能情况
xy. Is=to 00. Or xy is=to, eleven. Those
are the two possible cases that z is=to

116
00:09:15,342 --> 00:09:22,652
因为z是x和y的异或
由于这些事件是不相交的
zero. Because z is the XOR of x and y. Now,
these events are disjoint, so, this

117
00:09:22,652 --> 00:09:30,336
这个表达式可以简单地写成上面两式的和
expression can simply be written as the
sum of the two expressions given above. So

118
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:37,271
即(x,y)=(0,0)的概率
加上(x,y)=(1,1)的概率
basically, it's the probability that xy
is=to 00, plus the probability that xy,

119
00:09:37,552 --> 00:09:43,281
我们可以在表中找到这些概率
is=to eleven. So now we can simply look up
these probabilities in our table. So the

120
00:09:43,281 --> 00:09:47,874
(x,y)=(0,0)的概率是P0/2
probability that xy is equal to 00 is
simply p zero over two, and the

121
00:09:47,874 --> 00:09:53,156
(x,y)=(1,1)的概率是P1/2
probability that xy is equal to one, one
is simply p one over two. So we get P0

122
00:09:53,156 --> 00:09:58,818
所以最后概率是(P0+P1)/2
P0和P1是什么？
over two +P1 over two. But what do we kn-,
what do we know about P0 and P1? Well,

123
00:09:58,818 --> 00:10:03,819
它们是一个概率分布，所以P0+P1=1
it's a probability distribution.
Therefore, P0+P1 must =one. And therefore,

124
00:10:03,819 --> 00:10:09,482
因此分式为1/2。因为P0+P1=1
this fraction here must= to a half. P0+P1
is =to one. So therefore, the sum of these

125
00:10:09,482 --> 00:10:15,292
所以两者的和为1/2。结束了
我们已证完z=0的情况
two terms must = a half. And we're done.
Basically, we proved that the probability

126
00:10:15,292 --> 00:10:20,143
是1/2，因此z=1的概率也是1/2
that z is = to zero. Is one half,
therefore the probability that z is equal

127
00:10:20,143 --> 00:10:25,123
所以z是一均匀分布的随机变量
to one is also one half. Therefore z is a
uniform random variable. So the simple

128
00:10:25,123 --> 00:10:29,773
这个简单定理是XOR如此实用的主要原因
theorem is the main reason why XOR is so
useful in cartography. The last thing I

129
00:10:29,773 --> 00:10:34,437
关于离散概率我们最后想说的是生日悖论
wanna show you about discrete probability
is what's called the birthday paradox. And

130
00:10:34,437 --> 00:10:38,934
我这里简单说一下，因为后面我们还会看到它
I'm gonna do it really fast here because
we're gonna come back later on, and talk

131
00:10:38,934 --> 00:10:42,931
并会更详细地介绍之。生日悖论是说
about this in more detail. So, the
birthday paradox says the following

132
00:10:42,931 --> 00:10:47,370
我从全局U中选择n个随机变量
suppose I choose n random variables in our
universe u. Okay. And it just so happens

133
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:51,485
这些随机变量是相互独立的
that these variables are independent of
one another. They actually don't have to

134
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:55,651
它们不一定是均匀分布的
我们只需假定它们同分布
be uniform. All we need to assume is that
they're distributed in the same way. The

135
00:10:55,651 --> 00:10:59,818
最重要的是它们相互独立
most important property though is that
they're independent of one another. So the

136
00:10:59,818 --> 00:11:04,035
定理说如果取约U的大小的平方根个元素
theorem says that if you choose roughly
the square root of the size of u elements,

137
00:11:04,035 --> 00:11:08,202
我们可以忽略这个1.2，这不重要
we're kind of ignoring this 1.2 here, it
doesn't really matter. But if you choose

138
00:11:08,202 --> 00:11:12,471
但是如果你选择了U的大小的平方根个元素
square root of the size of u elements,
then basically there's a good chance that

139
00:11:12,471 --> 00:11:16,740
你选了两个相同元素的可能性很大
换句话说，如果你取样|U|的平方根次
there are two elements that are the same.
In other words, if you sample about square

140
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:21,158
很可能你的两次取样是相等的
root a few times, then it's likely that
two of your samples will be

141
00:11:21,158 --> 00:11:25,763
这个倒着的E表示存在，提醒一下大家
equal to one another. And by the way, I
should point out that this inverted E,

142
00:11:25,947 --> 00:11:30,860
所以存在i和j满足R(i)=R(j)
just means exists. So there exist the
I and j such that r I is equal

143
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:35,057
这是个具体的例子，我们还会见很多次
to r j. So here's a concrete example.
We'll actually see many, many times.

144
00:11:35,057 --> 00:11:39,493
设想我们的全局为全体128位字符串
Suppose our universe consist of all
strings of length of one hundred and

145
00:11:39,493 --> 00:11:44,279
那么U的大小很大，为2的128次方
twenty eight bits. So the size of U is
gigantic it's actually two to the hundred

146
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:49,123
它是一个很大很大的集合
但是如果你取样2的64次方次
and twenty eight. It's a very, very large
set. But it so happens if you sample say

147
00:11:49,123 --> 00:11:53,909
也就是U大小的平方根
around two the sixty four times from the
set. This is about the square root of U

148
00:11:53,909 --> 00:11:58,520
很有可能你的两次取样是同样的信息
then is very likely that two of your
sample messages will actually be the same.

149
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:02,871
为什么这叫悖论呢？
以前这个是在描述人们生日的时候说的
So why is, this called the paradox? Well,
traditionally it's described in terms of

150
00:12:02,871 --> 00:12:06,896
把这些取样视为某人的生日
people's birthdays. So you would think
that each of these samples would be

151
00:12:06,896 --> 00:12:11,772
问题就是：需要多少人
someone's birthday. And so the question is
how many people need to get together so

152
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:16,510
使得有两人的生日相同？
that there are two people that have the
same birthday? So, just as a simple

153
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:21,349
简单算一下，一年365天
calculation you can see there are 365 days in
the year, so you would need about 1.2

154
00:12:21,349 --> 00:12:26,656
需要1.2倍的365的平方根
times the square root of 365 people until
the probability that two of them have the

155
00:12:26,656 --> 00:12:31,327
这样有两人有相同生日的概率多于1/2
如果我没算错，是24人
same birthday is more than a half. This if
I'm not mistaken is about 24, which means

156
00:12:31,327 --> 00:12:35,673
意味着如果随机挑24人，集中在一个房间里
那么非常有可能有两人的生日
that if 24 random people get together in a
room it's very likely that two of them

157
00:12:35,673 --> 00:12:40,020
是相同的。这就是为什么叫悖论
will actually have the same birthday. This
is why it's called a paradox, because 24

158
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:44,457
因为24被认为是比人预期低得多
supposedly is a smaller number than you
would expect. Interestingly, people's
(这并不是逻辑上的悖论)

159
00:12:44,457 --> 00:12:50,401
有趣的是，人们的生日并不是365天均匀分布的
birthdays are not actually uniform across
all 365 days of the year. There's actually

160
00:12:50,401 --> 00:12:55,223
实际上有偏向于⑨月
不过我想这与我们的讨论无关
a bias towards September. But, I guess
that's not, that's not relative to the

161
00:12:55,223 --> 00:12:59,878
我最后想更具体地展示一下生日悖论
discussion here. The last thing I
wanted to do is just show you the birthday

162
00:12:59,878 --> 00:13:04,533
假设全局有一百万的样本
paradox a bit more concretely. So, suppose
we have a universe of about a million

163
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:09,244
如果我们取样约1200次
samples, then you can see that when we
sample roughly 1200 times, the probability

164
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:14,197
我们两次取到同样数的概率约为1/2
that we get, we sample the same number,
the same element twice is roughly half. But

165
00:13:14,197 --> 00:13:18,498
不过，两次取样相同的概率
the probability of sampling the same
number twice actually converges very

166
00:13:18,498 --> 00:13:22,857
很快收敛于1。如果我们取样2200次
quickly to one. You can see that if we
about 2200 items, then the probability

167
00:13:22,859 --> 00:13:26,790
两次取样相同的概率已是90%了
that two of those items are the same,
already is 90 percent and You know, 3000

168
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:30,440
3000次的时候基本上就是1了
所以是很快地收敛到1的
then it's basically one. So this
conversion is very quickly to one as soon

169
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:34,484
只要取样次数超过全局大小的平方根次
as he goes beyond the square root of the
size of the universe. So we're gonna come

170
00:13:34,484 --> 00:13:38,380
后面我们还会来看生日悖论的更多细节
back and study the birthday paradox in
more detail later on, but I just for now,

171
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:42,597
我现在只想让大家知道生日悖论是什么
那么我们结束本节
wanted you to know what it is. So that's
the end of this segment, and then in the

172
00:13:42,597 --> 00:13:49,509
下一节开始第一个加密系统
next segment we'll start with our first
example of encryption systems.
