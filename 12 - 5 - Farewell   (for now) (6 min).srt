1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,900
为时六周的课程就要完结了。我这门课讲的很愉悦
This brings us to the end of the six weeks
course. I had a lot of fun teaching this

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:07,566
希望大家也是。我非常喜欢课程的内容
course and I hope you enjoyed it too. I
really love this material and I always

3
00:00:07,566 --> 00:00:11,232
也总是乐意讲授它。在说再见之前，先快速回顾一下
enjoy teaching it. Before we say our
farewells, please do a quick review of the

4
00:00:11,232 --> 00:00:15,166
我们讨论过的话题，看看还剩下什么东西没讲
topics that we discussed and see what's
left to cover. So here's a brief diagram

5
00:00:15,166 --> 00:00:19,411
这是一个我们已经讨论过的密码学原型的简要图示。
如果大家还记得在第一周里
of the primitive that we discussed in the
class. If you remember in week one we

6
00:00:19,411 --> 00:00:23,762
我们从伪随机数发生器和流密码开始讨论
started off by discussing pseudorandom
generators and stream ciphers. In week two

7
00:00:23,762 --> 00:00:28,168
第二周我们讨论了分组密码，我们说过正确的思考
we talked about block ciphers and we said
that the right way to think about block

8
00:00:28,168 --> 00:00:32,734
分组密码的方式是当作伪随机置换和伪随机函数
cipher is as pseudorandom permutations and
pseudorandom functions. We said that using

9
00:00:32,734 --> 00:00:37,301
我们说过，通过使用计数器模式，我们可以把一个
分组密码转换成一个PRG。我们说过，使用GGM机制
counter mode we can convert a block cipher
into a PRG. And we said that using the GGM

10
00:00:37,301 --> 00:00:41,375
我们可以从伪随机发生器构建分组密码
construction. We can construct block
ciphers from pseudorandom generators. Then

11
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:45,271
然后在第三周，我们讨论了数据完整性
in week three, we talked about data
integrity. In particular, we talked about

12
00:00:45,271 --> 00:00:48,906
特别地，我们讨论了MAC，看了各种MAC机制
MACs and we looked at various
constructions of MACs from pseudorandom

13
00:00:48,906 --> 00:00:52,749
它们是基于伪随机函数，比如CMAC，HMAC，PMAC等等
functions like the CMAC, the HMAC, the
PMAC constructions and so on. We also

14
00:00:52,749 --> 00:00:57,164
我们还讨论了抗碰撞，我们说过抗碰撞可以被用来
discussed collision resistance and we said
that collision resistance can be used for

15
00:00:57,164 --> 00:01:01,111
保护数据完整性，当有只读内存的访问权限时
data integrity where one has access to
read-only memory. Basically, you would

16
00:01:01,111 --> 00:01:05,110
你可以使用抗碰撞的哈希函数计算数据的哈希值
hash the data using a collision resistance
hash function; write the hash into

17
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:09,369
向只读内存写哈希值。稍后当你想验证你的数据时
read-only memory. And then later, when you
want to verify authenticity of your data,

18
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:13,633
你只需比较它的哈希值和写在只读内存里的数据
you just compare its hash to whatever is
written in read-only memory. Then in week 4

19
00:01:13,633 --> 00:01:17,943
那么在第四周，我们讨论了如何把完整性和私密性结合起来
we talked about how to combine integrity
and confidentiality, in particular we

20
00:01:17,943 --> 00:01:22,640
特别地，我们讨论了把加密和MAC结合起来，以构建
kinda talk about to combine encryption and
MACs to build what we called Authenticated

21
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,951
所谓的认证加密。我告诉过大家，在实际中
Encryption and I told you that really in
practice, the only foremost Symmetric

22
00:01:26,951 --> 00:01:31,151
在对称加密中，你们只能使用认证加密
Encryption that you're allowed to use is
Authenticated Encryption. Basically,

23
00:01:31,151 --> 00:01:35,461
只对窃听保持安全的加密通常是不安全的
encryption that's only secure against
eavesdropping attacks is not generally

24
00:01:35,461 --> 00:01:39,827
大家必须时时刻刻提防数据被篡改，因此
secure, you must always also guard against
tampering and as a result, you should only

25
00:01:39,827 --> 00:01:44,388
大家应当只使用认证加密模式，来进行对称加密
be using Authenticated Encryption modes to
do Symmetric Encryption. So that was the

26
00:01:44,388 --> 00:01:48,574
那么这是第四周。第五周和第六周中，我们转变了话题
end of week four. And then for weeks five
and six, we switched topics and talked

27
00:01:48,574 --> 00:01:52,759
讨论了密钥交换和公钥加密。特别地，在第五周
about key exchange and public key encryption.
In particular, in week five we talked

28
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:56,247
我们讨论了陷门函数和Diffie-Hellman协议
about Trapdoor Functions and the
Diffie-Hellman Protocol within the

29
00:01:56,247 --> 00:02:00,594
还有为了解释这些东西如何工作的必要的数学
Mathematics that are necessary to explain
how those things work. And then in week

30
00:02:00,594 --> 00:02:05,048
然后在第六周，我们讨论了如何从陷门函数
six we talked about how public key encryption
can be built from trapdoor functions and,

31
00:02:05,048 --> 00:02:09,090
和Diffie-Hellman协议构建公钥加密。
我想强调一下，我们在第五周看到的
the Diffie-Hellman Protocol. I wanna
emphasize that the key exchange protocols

32
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:13,573
密钥交换协议只能安全地抵抗窃听攻击
that we saw in week five are only secure
against eavesdropping and should never be

33
00:02:13,573 --> 00:02:18,002
在实际中永远不应该被使用。事实上在第八周
我们将看到认证密钥交换协议
used in practice. In fact in week eight
we're gonna see authenticated key exchange

34
00:02:18,002 --> 00:02:22,485
那些是在现实中实际被使用的
protocols and those are the ones that are
actually used in the world for example in

35
00:02:22,485 --> 00:02:26,698
例如在SSL以及其他类似协议中。但是，我们在第五周
SSL and other protocols like that. But,
the ones that we saw in week five should

36
00:02:26,698 --> 00:02:31,018
看到的内容，在实际中永远不应该被使用的。
我们看这些简单密钥交换机制的原因
never actually be deployed in the real
world. The only reason we looked at those

37
00:02:31,018 --> 00:02:35,123
只是为了给陷门函数和Diffie-Hellman群做铺垫
simple key exchange mechanisms was as
motivation for trapdoor functions and

38
00:02:35,123 --> 00:02:39,064
现在如你所知，我们整个密码学课程还有四周
Diffie-Hellman groups. Now as you know there
are four more weeks to the full crypto

39
00:02:39,064 --> 00:02:42,934
我们以后还要上四周。在第七周我们将讨论
course which we're gonna do at a later
time. In week seven we're gonna talk about

40
00:02:42,934 --> 00:02:46,996
数字签名，以及如何认证数据，使得每个人
digital signatures and how to authenticate
data in a way that anyone can verify that

41
00:02:46,996 --> 00:02:50,866
都能认证数据的真实性。然后我们讨论认证密钥交换协议
the data is authentic. Then we're gonna
talk about authenticated key exchanges as

42
00:02:50,866 --> 00:02:54,640
如我所说的。然后我们将讨论用户认证，如何管理口令
I said then we're gonna talk about user
authentication, how to manage passwords,

43
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,319
一次性口令，挑战-应答协议，然后我们讨论
one time passwords, challenge-response
protocols. Then we'll talk about various

44
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:02,190
各种隐私机制。如何认证自己，同时又不会暴露自己身份？
privacy mechanisms. How to authenticate
yourself without revealing where you are,

45
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:06,284
如何在登录的同时，不会暴露自己是谁等等。。
How to sign in a way it doesn't reveal who
you are and so on and so forth. And in this part

46
00:03:06,284 --> 00:03:10,041
在这一部分里，为这些机制构建分组，实际上
of the building blocks for some of these
mechanisms, actually, we'll talk about

47
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:13,992
我们将讨论零知识证明，这是一个通用的工具
zero-knowledge protocols which is kind of
a general purpose tool that's used very

48
00:03:13,992 --> 00:03:17,821
在密码学中广泛使用。但是其实密码学已经超越了
widely in cryptography. But let's just say
that crypto goes way beyond this core

49
00:03:17,821 --> 00:03:21,687
这个基本内容，事实上还有很多话题我想跟大家说
topics and in fact, there are many, many
more topics that I would love to tell you

50
00:03:21,687 --> 00:03:25,554
如果时间允许的话。那么我制作了这张简短的表
about if there was enough time. So I made
this kind of a short list here and this isn't

51
00:03:25,554 --> 00:03:29,469
这张表并不完全。还有很多其他内容我想跟大家讨论
even an exhaustive list. There are many
other things that I would like to tell you

52
00:03:29,469 --> 00:03:33,383
那么如果反响够强，我可以开一门高等密码学课程
about and so if there's enough demand, I
might even run an advanced crypto class

53
00:03:33,383 --> 00:03:37,107
通常是我给研究生上的
which is usually what I do for graduate
students which would cover these more

54
00:03:37,107 --> 00:03:40,831
会涵盖更多的高级话题，但那将是明年的事了
advanced topics but that would actually
take place sometime next year so stay

55
00:03:40,831 --> 00:03:44,890
所以不要走开，当做出决定时，我会给出通知
tuned and I will send announcements on
when that's coming. So my final words of

56
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:49,427
当然，我对本课的最后几句话是：密码学是强大的工具
course remember my main message from this
class. And that crypto is a tremendous

57
00:03:49,427 --> 00:03:53,298
但是大家使用它时，应时刻小心谨慎
tool but you should always be careful when
you use it. If you implement crypto

58
00:03:53,298 --> 00:03:56,821
如果你错误地实现了密码，系统也会正常运行
incorrectly, the system will work
perfectly fine. It would be no way to

59
00:03:56,821 --> 00:04:00,791
无从判断其安全性，除非攻击者蓄意攻击系统时
tell that anything is wrong except when
attacker is trying to attack the system,

60
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:04,571
它将被轻易破解。所以密码学里
it might be easily breakable. And so
crypto is one of these things where a

61
00:04:04,571 --> 00:04:08,317
一丁点知识都可能是危险的
little bit of knowledge is quite
dangerous. It's quite important to make

62
00:04:08,317 --> 00:04:12,531
确保正确的实现是很重要的，一种确保的方法是
sure you get the implementation correctly
and one way to do that is to make sure

63
00:04:12,531 --> 00:04:16,850
总是让别人来审查你的代码和设计
that always other people review your code
and your designs to find any bugs in the

64
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:21,116
找出密码实现里的漏洞，甚至是设计层面的更一般的漏洞
crypto implementation or even more general
bugs in the system design. And finally

65
00:04:21,116 --> 00:04:25,313
最后我留给大家这些结束语：大家永远不要
I'll leave you with these parting words, that you should never ever invent your own

66
00:04:25,313 --> 00:04:29,454
自己发明密码，也不要去实现自己的密码和模式
ciphers or your own modes and you should
never even implement your own ciphers or

67
00:04:29,454 --> 00:04:33,242
尽可能地坚持使用标准
your own modes. Try to stick to the
standards as much as possible. Try to

68
00:04:33,242 --> 00:04:37,535
尽可能地坚持使用算法的标准实现
stick to standard implementations of those
algorithms as much as possible and if you

69
00:04:37,535 --> 00:04:41,778
如果万不得已，那么要确保你的工作有充分的
have to deviate from that, then just make
sure there's sufficient third party review

70
00:04:41,778 --> 00:04:46,557
第三方审查。好，那么我这里先说再见了
of what you've done. Okay, so I will
say my farewell here. And let me say that

71
00:04:46,557 --> 00:04:50,956
告诉大家，期终考试将在第七周上线
the final exam will be made available on
week seven, basically, a week after the

72
00:04:50,956 --> 00:04:55,688
第六周后一周，所有讲座将向公众开放。
期终考试将涵盖六周的全部内容
week six lectures become public. The final
exam will cover material for all six weeks

73
00:04:55,688 --> 00:05:00,309
它和问题集的格式差不多
and it'll pretty much be the same format
as the problem sets. I hope everybody will

74
00:05:00,309 --> 00:05:04,764
我希望大家在考试中都能做得很好，当工作完成后可以领证书
do well in the exam and we will send
certificates once all those course work is

75
00:05:04,764 --> 00:05:09,348
我希望在本课程的第二季里看到大家
complete and I hope to see you in the next
iteration of this course whenever that's

76
00:05:09,348 --> 00:05:12,992
那么该说再见了，请在论坛里提交你们的
made available. So farewell, and as
always, please submit your comments and

77
00:05:12,992 --> 00:05:16,986
评论和建议，我读了大家所有的评论，
它们对于改善本课程很有帮助
suggestions on the forum. I read all of
your posts and they're very, very helpful

78
00:05:16,986 --> 00:05:19,582
希望在这个秋天还能见到大家
in improving the course. Hope to see you
in the fall.
