00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,785
大家好，我是Dan Boneh，欢迎来到我的密码学课程
Hello, my name is Dan Boneh, and I'd like to welcome you to my course on cryptography
【ikamusume酱 译注】

2
00:00:03,785 --> 00:00:07,522
这个学季我将在斯坦福大学讲授这门课程
that I'll be teaching at Stanford University this quarter. This quarter, I'm experimenting

3
00:00:07,522 --> 00:00:11,652
我实验一下讲座录像，以便同学在线观看
with recording the lectures and having the students watch the lectures online.

4
00:00:11,652 --> 00:00:15,438
事实上，欢迎任何人观看讲座，加入课程
In fact, anyone is welcome to watch the lectures, and join the course.

5
00:00:15,438 --> 00:00:19,211
此为实验，让我们拭目以待
This is an experiment, so we'll see how it goes. My goals for this

6
00:00:19,211 --> 00:00:23,151
本课程目的是讲授密码学基本原型是如何工作的
course are basically to teach you how cryptographic primitives work.

7
00:00:23,151 --> 00:00:27,449
更重要的，我将告诉大家如何正确使用密码学原型
But more importantly I'd like to teach you how to use cryptographic primitives correctly

8
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:30,928
以及推导构建加密机制的安全性
and reason about the security of your constructions. We will see various

9
00:00:30,928 --> 00:00:35,175
我们将看到不同的密码学原型的抽象，
还会进行一些安全性证明
abstractions of cryptographic primitives, and we'll do some security proofs.

10
00:00:35,175 --> 00:00:39,013
我的目标是在课程结束后，大家可以推导加密机制的安全性
My goal is that by the end of the course you'll be able to reason about the security of cryptographic

11
00:00:39,013 --> 00:00:43,211
可以破解不安全的加密机制
constructions and be able to break ones that are not secure.

12
00:00:43,211 --> 00:00:47,424
关于如何上本课，简单说两句
Now I'd like to say a few words on how I would like you to take the class. First of all,

13
00:00:47,424 --> 00:00:51,688
首先，我非常推荐听讲座的时候记笔记
I'm a big believer in taking notes as you listen to the lectures. So I would really

14
00:00:51,688 --> 00:00:55,953
我鼓励大家用自己的话归纳总结讲演内容
encourage you to summarize and take notes in your own words of the material that's being presented.

15
00:00:55,953 --> 00:00:59,909
提醒一下，录像的讲演速度比正规课堂快得多
Also I should mention that on the videos, I'm able to go much faster

16
00:00:59,909 --> 00:01:03,865
所以我建议大家
than I would go in a normal classroom. And so I would encourage you to

17
00:01:03,865 --> 00:01:07,924
经常暂停视频，理清讲座内容
periodically pause the video and think about the material that's being covered

18
00:01:07,924 --> 00:01:12,038
知道弄清楚了以后再继续
and not move forward until the material is clear in your mind. Also from time to time,

19
00:01:12,038 --> 00:01:15,961
偶尔视频自动暂停，会有弹出问题
the video will pause and pop-up questions will come up.

20
00:01:15,961 --> 00:01:20,347
它们是帮助大家理解讲座内容的
These are intended to kinda help you along with the material, and I would really encourage you to answer

21
00:01:20,347 --> 00:01:24,682
我建议大家回答这些问题，而不是跳过
those questions by yourselves rather than skip them. Usually the questions

22
00:01:24,682 --> 00:01:28,811
通常这些问题都是关于刚刚讲过的内容，不会太难
are about the material that has just been covered, and so it shouldn't be too difficult to answer

23
00:01:28,811 --> 00:01:32,991
所以我非常鼓励大家去做，而不是跳过
the questions. So I would really encourage you to do them rather than skip them.

24
00:01:32,991 --> 00:01:37,016
现在，我确定上这门课的大家都知道,
密码学在计算机领域无处不在
Now, by now I'm sure everybody taking the class knows that cryptography is used

25
00:01:37,016 --> 00:01:41,843
它是保护数据的常见工具
everywhere computers are. It's a very common tool that's used to protect data.

26
00:01:41,843 --> 00:01:46,760
例如，网页流量可使用HTTPS协议保护
For example, web traffic is protected using a protocol called HTTPS.

27
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:51,193
无线流量，比如WiFi，可使用WPA2保护
Wireless traffic, for example, Wi-Fi traffic is protected using the, WPA2

28
00:01:51,193 --> 00:01:55,656
WPA2是802.11i的一部分。
手机流量可使用GSM加密机制保护
protocol, that's part of 801.11i. Cell phone traffic is protected

29
00:01:55,656 --> 00:02:00,177
蓝牙流量也可使用密码学保护，等等
using an encryption mechanism in GSM. Bluetooth
traffic is protected using cryptography,

30
00:02:00,177 --> 00:02:04,640
我们将看到这些不同系统是如何工作的
and so on. We're gonna see how these various systems work. In fact, we're gonna

31
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,276
事实上，我们将介绍SSL，还有802.11i的一些细节
cover SSL, and in fact, even 802.11i in quite a bit of detail. And you'll see how

32
00:02:09,276 --> 00:02:13,275
大家会看到这些系统实际应用中是如何工作的。
密码学还可用来保护文件
these system work in practice. Cryptography is also used for protecting files

33
00:02:13,275 --> 00:02:17,564
可以加密存储在硬盘上的文件。如果硬盘被盗
that are stored on disc by encrypting them. So if the disc is stolen,

34
00:02:17,564 --> 00:02:22,444
文件内容也不会被窃取。这也适用于内容保护
the files are not compromised. It's also used for content protection. For example

35
00:02:22,444 --> 00:02:27,480
例如，当你买DVDs和蓝光碟时，上面的电影被加密的
when you buy DVDs and Blu-Ray disks, the movies on these disks are encrypted, in

36
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:32,516
DVD使用的是CSS系统，也叫内容混淆系统
particular DVD uses a system called CSS, the Content Scrambling System, CSS, and

37
00:02:32,516 --> 00:02:37,934
蓝光碟使用的是AACS系统。
我们会介绍CSS和AACS如何工作
Blu-Ray uses a system called AACS. We'll talk about how CSS and AACS work.

38
00:02:37,934 --> 00:02:43,033
事实上CSS是一个比较容易破解的系统
It turns out that CSS is a fairly easy system to break.

39
00:02:43,033 --> 00:02:48,132
我们将介绍如何分析和破解CSS中的加密
And we'll talk about how, we'll do some cryptanalysis and actually show how to break encryption that's used in CSS.

40
00:02:48,132 --> 00:02:52,532
密码学也可被用于认证
Cryptography is also used for user authentication and in many, many, many

41
00:02:52,532 --> 00:02:56,832
在接下来的几节里用非常多的应用
other applications that we'll talk about in the next segments.  Now I wanna go back

42
00:02:56,832 --> 00:03:00,642
现在我想回到安全通信，讨论这个情况：
我有一台笔记本电脑
to secure communication, and talk about the case where, here, we have a laptop

43
00:03:00,642 --> 00:03:04,753
它正试图与一个网页服务器通信。
这也是介绍我们的朋友们的好机会
trying to communicate with a web server. This is a good time to also introduce our friends,

44
00:03:04,753 --> 00:03:08,964
他们是Alice和Bob，他们贯穿于整个学季
Alice and Bob, who are gonna be with us throughout the quarter. Essentially Alice

45
00:03:08,964 --> 00:03:13,305
Alice总是想与Bob安全通信。
Alice在笔记本一端，Bob在服务器端
is trying to communicate securely with Bob. Here Alice is on the laptop and Bob

46
00:03:13,305 --> 00:03:18,223
使用协议叫做HTTPS，但事实上
is on the server. The protocol that's used to do that is called HTTPS, but in fact,

47
00:03:18,223 --> 00:03:22,717
实际使用的是SSL，有时又叫TLS
the actual protocol is called SSL. Sometimes it's called TLS.
(注意这三个其实是不同的协议)

48
00:03:22,717 --> 00:03:27,695
目的是确保数据在网络中传输时
And the goals of these protocols is to basically make sure that as this data travels across the

49
00:03:27,695 --> 00:03:32,492
首先，攻击者无法窃听数据内容
network, an attacker first of all can't eavesdrop on this data. Second of all, an

50
00:03:32,492 --> 00:03:37,592
其次，攻击者不能修改数据，即无窃听、无篡改
attacker can't modify the data while it's in the network. So no eavesdropping and no tampering.

51
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:42,413
现在我来谈谈用来保护网页安全的TLS
Now as I said the protocol that's used to secure web traffic called TLS

52
00:03:42,413 --> 00:03:46,998
TLS实际上由两部分组成。第一部分叫做握手协议
actually consists of two parts. The first part is called the handshake protocol

53
00:03:46,998 --> 00:03:51,955
Alice和Bob互相交谈，在握手的最后
where Alice and Bob talk with one another and at the end of the handshake

54
00:03:51,955 --> 00:03:56,601
双方分享一个密钥
handshake basically a shared secret key appears between the two of them. So both

55
00:03:56,601 --> 00:04:01,093
所以Alice和Bob都知道该密钥，
但攻击者不知道会话密钥K
Alice and Bob know this secret key, but an attacker looking at the conversation has

56
00:04:01,093 --> 00:04:05,167
现在，建立密钥，握手
no idea what the key K is. Now, the way you established your secret key, the way

57
00:04:05,167 --> 00:04:09,503
都用到了公钥密码技术
you do the handshake, is using public key cryptography techniques, which we're gonna talk

58
00:04:09,503 --> 00:04:13,473
我们在本课第二部分讨论之。现在Alice和Bob共享密钥
about in the second part of the course. Now once Alice and Bob have the shared key,

59
00:04:13,473 --> 00:04:17,025
你可以使用这个密钥加密数据，安全通信
you can use this key to communicate securely by properly

60
00:04:17,025 --> 00:04:21,364
这是本课的第一部分
encrypting data between them. And in fact this is gonna be the first part of the course,

61
00:04:21,364 --> 00:04:25,740
也就是双方共享密钥时
which is essentially once the two sides have a shared secret key, how do they use

62
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:30,060
如何使用密钥加密以保护通信数据？
that secret key to encrypt and protect data that goes back and forth between them?

63
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:34,404
如前所说，密码学另一应用为保护硬盘文件
Now, as I said, another application of cryptography is to protect

64
00:04:34,404 --> 00:04:38,934
这里你有一已加密文件
files on disk. So, here you have a file that happens to be encrypted, so that even

65
00:04:38,934 --> 00:04:43,407
即使硬盘被偷，攻击者其实无法读取文件数据
if the disk is stolen, an attacker can't actually read the contents in the file.

66
00:04:43,407 --> 00:04:47,881
如果攻击者改动硬盘上文件数据
And, if an attacker tries to modify the data on disk, the data in the file while

67
00:04:47,881 --> 00:04:52,241
当Alice试图解密文件时，会检测出改动
it's on disk, when Alice tries to decrypt this file, that will be detected, and

68
00:04:52,241 --> 00:04:56,205
Alice便会忽略文件内容
she'll then basically ignore the contents of the file. So we have both confidentiality

69
00:04:56,205 --> 00:05:00,999
所以我们有文件的私密性和完整性。这里有一点哲学的东西
confidentiality and integrity for files stored on disk. Now I want to make a minor philosophical

70
00:05:00,999 --> 00:05:06,098
事实上加密硬盘上的文件
point, that in fact storing encrypted files on disk is very much the same

71
00:05:06,098 --> 00:05:10,872
与保护Alice和Bob之间的通信很类似
as protecting communication between Alice and Bob. In particular, when you

72
00:05:10,872 --> 00:05:15,379
特别地，当你存储文件在磁盘上时，
基本上是保存文件的Alice明天还想看这个文件
store files on disk, it's basically Alice who stores the file today wants to read

73
00:05:15,379 --> 00:05:19,580
所以与Alice和Bob通信不同
the file tomorrow. So rather than communicating between two parties Alice and Bob,

74
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:23,713
存储文件加密就是今天的Alice
in the case of a stored disk encryption, it's Alice today who is

75
00:05:23,713 --> 00:05:27,966
和明天的Alice通信
但这两种情形：安全通信和安全文件
communicating with Alice tomorrow. But really the two scenarios, secure

76
00:05:27,966 --> 00:05:32,632
从哲学上讲是一样的
communications, and secure files, are kind of philosophically the same. Now, the

77
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:37,001
以分组的形式保护流量的技术叫做对称加密
building block for securing traffic is what's called symmetric encryption

78
00:05:37,001 --> 00:05:41,666
在本课的第一部分，我们将详细介绍
systems. And we're gonna talk, in the first half of the course extensively about

79
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:46,035
对称加密系统。在对称加密系统中
symmetric encryption systems. So in a symmetric encryption system, basically, the two parties,

80
00:05:46,035 --> 00:05:50,699
Alice和Bob双方共享密钥k
攻击者不知道密钥k
Alice and Bob, share a secret key k, which the attacker does not

81
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:55,069
只有通信双方知道密钥k
现在他们将使用两个算法进行秘密通信
know. Only they know the secret key k. Now, they're gonna use a cipher which

82
00:05:55,069 --> 00:05:59,755
两个算法分别是E和D。
E是加密算法，D是解密算法
consists of these two algorithms, E and D. E is called an encryption algorithm and D

83
00:05:59,755 --> 00:06:04,179
加密算法以原信息和密钥为输入
is called the decryption algorithm. The encryption algorithm takes the message and

84
00:06:04,179 --> 00:06:08,051
产生相应密文
the key as inputs, and produces a corresponding ciphertext. And the

85
00:06:08,051 --> 00:06:12,564
解密算法则正好相反
它以密文和密钥为输入，输出原信息
decryption algorithm does the opposite. It takes the ciphertext as input along with the key

86
00:06:12,564 --> 00:06:16,594
现在有一点很重要
key and produces the corresponding message. Now, a very important point that

87
00:06:16,594 --> 00:06:21,108
我需要强调，我只说一次
I would like to stress. I'm only gonna say this once now and never again, but it is an

88
00:06:21,108 --> 00:06:25,467
尽管它很重要：
算法E和D，即实际加密算法
extremely important point. And that is: that the algorithms E and D, the actual

89
00:06:25,467 --> 00:06:30,400
它们是面向公众公开的
攻击者知道算法是如何工作的
encryption algorithms are publicly known. Adversary knows exactly how they work. The

90
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,411
只有密钥k是保密的
only thing that's kept secret is the secret key k. Other than that

91
00:06:34,411 --> 00:06:38,880
其余都是公开的
明白这一点很重要
everything else is completely public and it's really important to realize that you

92
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:43,080
你应当只使用公开的加密算法
should only use algorithms that are public because those algorithms have been

93
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:47,685
因为公开算法已被数以百计的业内人士
检查了很多很多年
peer-reviewed by a very large community of hundreds of people for many, many, many years,

94
00:06:47,685 --> 00:06:52,460
而且只有业内证实无法破解这些算法
它们才开始被使用
and these algorithms only begin to be used once this community has shown that

95
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:56,952
事实上，如果有人跟你说
嘿，我有一个私有的加密方法
they cannot be broken, essentially. So in fact, if somebody comes to you and says, hey, I have a proprietary

96
00:06:56,952 --> 00:07:01,500
问你要不要用。答案通常是
cipher that you might want to use, the answer usually should be that

97
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:06,162
坚持标准算法，摒弃私有算法
you stick to standards, to standard algorithms, and not use a proprietary

98
00:07:06,162 --> 00:07:10,710
事实上，有很多私有加密算法的例子
cipher. In fact, there are many examples of proprietary ciphers that, as soon as

99
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:14,690
它们一旦被逆向工程，很容易被分析破解
they were reverse engineered, they were easily broken by simple analysis.

100
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:19,716
我们将在课程的第一部分讨论
即使在对称加密的一些简单情形中
Now, even in the simple cases of symmetric encryption which we're gonna discuss

101
00:07:19,716 --> 00:07:24,782
我们将讨论两种情况
in the first half of the course, there are actually two cases that we're gonna discuss in turn.

102
00:07:24,782 --> 00:07:29,974
第一，每个密钥只加密一个信息
The first, is when every key is only used to encrypt a

103
00:07:29,974 --> 00:07:34,597
我们叫一次密钥。举个例子
single message, we call these one time keys. Okay. So for example, when you

104
00:07:34,597 --> 00:07:39,853
当你加密电子邮件时，
通常不同邮件使用不同密钥加密
encrypt email messages, it's very common that every single email is encrypted using

105
00:07:39,853 --> 00:07:44,922
对吧？不同的对称密钥
a different symmetric key. Yeah? Different symmetric cipher key. Because the key is

106
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:49,588
因为一个密钥只加密一个信息
有很多有效简便的方法
used to encrypt only one message there are actually fairly efficient and simple ways of

107
00:07:49,588 --> 00:07:54,090
可以用一次密钥进行加密
我们在下一模块进行讨论
encrypting messages using these one time keys and we'll discuss those actually

108
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:58,371
还有许多情况是用密钥加密多个信息
in the next module. Now there are many cases in fact where keys

109
00:07:58,371 --> 00:08:02,488
我们称之为多次密钥
need to be used to encrypt multiple messages. We call these many time keys.

110
00:08:02,488 --> 00:08:06,715
例如，加密文件系统里的文件
同一密钥用来加密很多不同的文件
For example, when you encrypt files in a file system the same key is used

111
00:08:06,715 --> 00:08:11,326
事实上，如果用一个密钥加密多个信息
to encrypt many many, different files. And it turns out if the key is now going to be used to encrypt

112
00:08:11,326 --> 00:08:15,662
我们需要更多的机制来确保加密系统是安全的
multiple messages, we need a little bit of more machinery to make sure that the

113
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:19,729
事实上，在我们讨论一次性密钥之后
encryption system is secure. In fact after we talk about the one-time keys, we

114
00:08:19,729 --> 00:08:23,570
我们还将谈谈为多次密钥设计的加密机制
will move over and talk about encryption modes that are specifically designed for

115
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:27,505
我们将会看到为了确保安全
many-time keys. And we'll see that there are a couple more steps that need to be taken to

116
00:08:27,505 --> 00:08:31,267
需要有更多的步骤。好，最后我说一点
ensure security in those cases. Okay, the last point I wanna make

117
00:08:31,267 --> 00:08:35,346
关于密码学有几点特别重要，需要记住
is that there are a couple of important things to remember about cryptography. First of all,

118
00:08:35,346 --> 00:08:39,689
首先，密码学当然是保护计算机信息的优秀工具
cryptography, of course, is a fantastic tool for protecting information in computer systems.

119
00:08:39,689 --> 00:08:43,820
但是，很重要的是，密码学也有其局限性
However, it's also very important that cryptography has its limitations.

120
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:48,225
首先，密码学不能解决所有安全问题
First of all, cryptography is really not the solution to all security problems.

121
00:08:48,225 --> 00:08:52,546
例如，如果软件有bug，
通常密码学无能为力
For example, if you have software bugs then very often cryptography is not

122
00:08:52,546 --> 00:08:56,925
类似的，如果你担心社会工程的攻击
going to be able to help you. Similarly, if you're worried about social engineering attacks,

123
00:08:56,925 --> 00:09:01,587
比如攻击者试图欺骗用户去做
会伤害到用户自己的事
where the attacker tries to fool the user into taking actions

124
00:09:01,587 --> 00:09:05,966
那么这时密码学通常派不上用场
that are going to hurt the user, then cryptography is very often actually not

125
00:09:05,966 --> 00:09:10,328
这点很重要，尽管密码学很厉害
going to help you. So it's very important that although it's a fabulous tool, it's not the

126
00:09:10,328 --> 00:09:14,798
但它不是解决安全问题的万能钥匙
另一非常重要的一点是
solution to all security problems. Now another very important point is that cryptography

127
00:09:14,798 --> 00:09:19,108
如果实现不正确，密码学将是无用的
essentially becomes useless if it's implemented incorrectly. So, for example,

128
00:09:19,108 --> 00:09:23,270
例如，有很多系统正常工作
there are a number of systems that work perfectly fine. And we'll see examples of those

129
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:27,487
我们会看到这样的系统，允许Alice和Bob通信
systems, that, in fact, allow Alice and Bob to communicate. And,

130
00:09:27,487 --> 00:09:31,595
信息由Alice发向Bob，
Bob接收并解密
in fact, messages that Alice sent to Bob, Bob can receive and decrypt. However,

131
00:09:31,595 --> 00:09:35,776
但是由于密码学不正确地实现，
系统完全是不安全的
because cryptography is implemented incorrectly, the systems are completely insecure.

132
00:09:35,776 --> 00:09:40,537
这里我应该提及一个老的加密标准WEP
Actually I should say that I like to mention an old encryption standard

133
00:09:40,537 --> 00:09:45,240
WEP用来加密WiFi流量的
called WEP this is used for encrypting Wi-Fi traffic. WEP contains many

134
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:49,942
WEP有很多错误，本课里我会为大家展示
mistakes in it and often when I wanna show you how not to do things in cryptography

135
00:09:49,942 --> 00:09:54,581
我会以WEP的内容为例，对我来说
有这样一个协议为例很是幸运
I will point to how things were done in WEP as an example. So for me, it's very fortunate to have an example,

136
00:09:54,581 --> 00:09:58,610
我能告诉大家如何避免这些错误
a protocol I can point to for how not to do things. And finally, a very

137
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:02,540
另一个非常重要的是
important point that I'd like you to remember is that cryptography is not

138
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:06,270
密码学不是让你自己去发明设计
something you should try to invent and design yourself. As I said, there are

139
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:09,902
我说过，密码学有标准，我们会详细讨论
standards in cryptography, standard cryptographic primitives which we're gonna discuss

140
00:10:09,902 --> 00:10:13,795
这些标准化的密码学原型
at length during this course. And primarily you're supposed to use

141
00:10:13,795 --> 00:10:17,656
你只需使用这些标准，而不是发明它们
these standard cryptographic primitives, and not invent things, these primitives,

142
00:10:17,656 --> 00:10:21,624
这些标准经历了多年数百人的检验
yourself. The standards have all gone through, many years of

143
00:10:21,624 --> 00:10:25,860
它们不是随意设计的
review by hundreds of people, and that's not something that's going to happen to an ad hoc design.

144
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:29,668
我说过，多年来有很多随意设计的加密机制
And, as I said, over the years there are many examples of

145
00:10:29,668 --> 00:10:33,797
一经分析即被攻破
ad hoc designs that were immediately broken as soon as they were analyzed.
