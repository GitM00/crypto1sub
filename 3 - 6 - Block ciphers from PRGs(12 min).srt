1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,388
本节我们研究是否可以从更简单的原型
In this segment we ask whether we can
build block ciphers from simpler

2
00:00:04,388 --> 00:00:09,456
比如伪随机数发生器，来构建分组密码
答案是肯定的。一开始
primitives like pseudo random generators.
The answer is yes. So to begin with, let's

3
00:00:09,456 --> 00:00:14,215
我们研究是否可以从伪随机数发生器
构建伪随机函数
ask whether we can build pseudo random
functions as opposed to pseudo random

4
00:00:14,215 --> 00:00:18,789
而不是伪随机置换。我们能否由PRG构建PRF？
permutations from a pseudo random
generator. Can we build a PRF from a PRG?

5
00:00:18,789 --> 00:00:23,873
尽管我们的最终目标是构建一个分组密码
本质上是个PRP
Our ultimate goal though is to build a
block cipher which is a PRP. And we'll get

6
00:00:23,873 --> 00:00:29,130
我们最后会实现之。好，现在我们构建一个PRF
我们从PRG开始
to that at the end. Okay, for now we build
a PRF. So let's start with a PRG that

7
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:34,590
PRG有两个输入，种子就是密钥空间K里的元素
doubles its inputs so the seeds for the
PRG is an element in K and the output is

8
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:39,420
输出实际上是K里的两个元素
这里我们有发生器的机制
actually two elements in K. So here we
have a schematic of the generator, that

9
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:44,296
取输入为C和K，然后输出两个K中元素
basically takes his input of C and K, and
outputs two elements, in K as its output.

10
00:00:44,296 --> 00:00:48,992
这个安全的意义是什么？
And now what does it mean for this purity
to be secure, recall this means that

11
00:00:48,992 --> 00:00:52,965
记得其意义是输出与一个K^2中的随机元素
essentially the output is
indistinguishable from a random element

12
00:00:52,965 --> 00:00:58,355
不可区分。其实根据PRG，是非常容易定义
inside of K squared. Now it turns out that
it's very easy to define basically what's

13
00:00:58,355 --> 00:01:03,455
PRF中的一位的。PRF中的一位
called a one bit PRF from this PRG. So
what's a one bit PRF is basically a PRF

14
00:01:03,455 --> 00:01:08,360
就是说PRF的定义域只有一位。好
这个PRF只取一位作为输入
who's domain is only one bit. Okay, so
it's a PRF that just takes one bit as

15
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:13,461
好，我们说，如果输入位X是0
input. Okay, and the way we'll do it is
we'll say is if the input bit X is zero

16
00:01:13,461 --> 00:01:18,627
我会用左边的输出；如果输入位X是1
I'll put the left output and if the input
bit X is one then I'll put the right

17
00:01:18,627 --> 00:01:23,678
我会用右边的PRF输出。好，我们写成符号的形式
output of the PRF. Okay, in symbols we
basically have what we wrote here. Now it

18
00:01:23,678 --> 00:01:28,523
现在很直接地就看成，事实上如果G是个安全PRG
is straightforward to show, that in fact G
is a secure PRG, then this one bit PRF is

19
00:01:28,523 --> 00:01:32,901
那么这个一位PRF也是安全的。大家想一想
in fact a secure PRF. If you think about
it for a second, this really is

20
00:01:32,901 --> 00:01:37,571
这其实是废话，把同样的事情说了两遍
tautology. Its really just stating the
same thing twice. So I will leave it for

21
00:01:37,571 --> 00:01:42,241
我留给大家思考，说服自己
you to think about this briefly and see
and convince yourself that in fact this

22
00:01:42,241 --> 00:01:46,853
这个定理是正确的。真正的问题是
我们能否构建一个PRF
theorem is true. The real question is
whether we can build a PRF, that actually

23
00:01:46,853 --> 00:01:51,756
它的定义域比一位多。理想情况下，
我们让定义域为128位
has a domain that is bigger than one bit.
Ideally we would like the domain to be 128

24
00:01:51,756 --> 00:01:56,425
就像AES一样。那么问题是我们能否
bits, just say as AES has. So
the question is can we build 128 bit PRF

25
00:01:56,425 --> 00:02:01,197
由一个伪随机数发生器，构建一个128位PRF？
我们来看能不能取得进展
from a pseudo random generator. Well so
let's see if we can make progress. So the

26
00:02:01,197 --> 00:02:05,970
那么我们要做的第一件事是，从一个PRG出发
first thing we're gonna do is we're gonna
say, well again, let's start with a PRG

27
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:10,863
输入长度翻倍，我们看能否构造一个PRG接受四倍输入
that doubles its input, let's see if we can
build a PRG that quadruples its inputs.

28
00:02:10,863 --> 00:02:15,797
好吧？它从K映射到K^4，而不是K到K^2，好
Okay? So it goes from K to K to the fourth
instead of K to K squared. Okay, so let's

29
00:02:15,797 --> 00:02:20,809
那么我们来看怎么做的。我们从一个初始的PRG开始
see how to do this. So here we start with
our original PRG that just doubles its

30
00:02:20,809 --> 00:02:25,884
扩充它的输入，记住这是个PRG
inputs, now remember that the fact that
this is a PRG means that the output of the

31
00:02:25,884 --> 00:02:30,771
意味着它的输出和K中的两个随机值不可区分
PRG is indistinguishable from two random
values in K. Well, if the output looks

32
00:02:30,771 --> 00:02:35,847
如果输出和K中的两个随机值看上去很像
我们可以对这两个输出再次使用发生器
like two random values in K, we can simply
apply the generator again to those two

33
00:02:35,847 --> 00:02:40,358
那么我们说，对左边的输出应用一次发生器
outputs. So let's say we apply the
generator once to the left output, and

34
00:02:40,358 --> 00:02:45,342
对右边也应用一次。我们称这四元组的输出
once to the rights outputs. And we are
going to call the output of that, this

35
00:02:45,342 --> 00:02:50,448
为G1K。我写下这个发生器生成的符号
quadruple of elements, we are, are going
to call that G1K. And I wrote down in

36
00:02:50,448 --> 00:02:55,554
但大家可以从这幅图里看到
symbols what this generator does, but you
can see basically from this figure,

37
00:02:55,554 --> 00:03:00,862
发生器到底做了什么。现在我们有一个
从K到K^4的发生器
exactly how the generator works. So now
that we have a generator from K to K to

38
00:03:00,862 --> 00:03:06,170
我们有了一个两位的PRF
the fourth, We actually get a two bit PRF.
Namely, what we will do is, we will say,

39
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:11,410
给定两位，00,01,10或11，会确定
given two bits, 00, 01, 10 or 11, will
imply output the appropriate block that

40
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:16,070
G1K输出的合适的分组。好，现在我们有了
一个有4种可能输入的PRF
the output of G1K. Okay, so now we can
basically have a PRF that takes four

41
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:21,061
而不是像前面那样，只有两种可能输入了
possible inputs as opposed to just two
possible inputs as before. So the question

42
00:03:21,061 --> 00:03:26,113
那么问题是为什么这个G1是安全的？
为什么这是个安全的PRG？
you should be asking me is why is this G1
case secure? Why is it a secure PRG? That

43
00:03:26,113 --> 00:03:30,611
那就是为什么这个四元组输出与
随机序列不可被区分
is why is this quadruple of outputs
indistinguishable from random. And so

44
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:35,664
我们来快速证明一下，以图的形式
let's do a quick proof of this, we'll just
do a simple proof by pictures. So here's

45
00:03:35,664 --> 00:03:40,408
这是我们的发生器，我们试图证明其安全性
our generator that we want to prove is
secure. And what that means is that we

46
00:03:40,408 --> 00:03:45,399
这意味着我们想证明这个分布是与
want to argue that this distribution is
indistinguishable from a random four-tuple

47
00:03:45,399 --> 00:03:49,292
K^4中的随机四元组不可区分。好
我们的目标是证明
in K to the fourth. Okay so our goal is to
prove that these two are

48
00:03:49,292 --> 00:03:53,887
这两个是不可区分的。好，一步一步来
indistinguishable. Well let's do it one
step at a time. We know that the generator

49
00:03:53,887 --> 00:03:58,028
我们知道这个发生器是安全的，因此第一层的输出
is a secure generator, therefore in fact
the output of the first level is

50
00:03:58,028 --> 00:04:02,453
与随机不可区分。换句话说，如果我们用
indistinguishable from random. In other
words, if we replace the first level by

51
00:04:02,453 --> 00:04:06,991
真随机字符串来替换第一层，这两个是从
密钥空间里随机选取的
truly random strings, these two are truly
random picked in the key space, then no

52
00:04:10,267 --> 00:04:11,359
那么没有有效的攻击可以区分这两个分布
efficient adversary should be able to
distinguish these two distributions. In

53
00:04:11,359 --> 00:04:15,954
事实上，如果大家可以区分这两个分布
fact, if you could distinguish these two
distributions, it's easy to show that you

54
00:04:15,954 --> 00:04:20,768
容易证明大家可以破解最初的PRG。好
大家看得出我们进行替换的原因
would break the original PRG. Okay, but
essentially you see that the reason we can

55
00:04:20,768 --> 00:04:25,581
我们之所以可以用真随机值来替换G的输出
do this replacement, we can replace the
output of G, with truly random values, is

56
00:04:25,581 --> 00:04:30,578
是因为PRG的定义所致，PRG的输出
exactly because of the definition of the
PRG, which says the output of the PRG is

57
00:04:30,578 --> 00:04:35,391
和随机不可区分。所以我们也可以把随机数放在那
indistinguishable from random, so we might
as well just put random there, and no

58
00:04:35,391 --> 00:04:40,265
没有有效的攻击可以区分这两个分布
efficient adversary can distinguish the
resulting two distributions. Okay, so far

59
00:04:40,265 --> 00:04:45,018
目前都还不错，现在我们要对左边做同样的事情
so good, but now we can do the same thing
again to the left hand side. In other

60
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:49,710
换句话说，我们可以用真随机替换这两个伪随机输出
words, we can replace these two pseudo
random outputs, by truly random outputs.

61
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:53,925
还是因为发生器G是安全的，没有有效的攻击
And again because the generator G is
secure, no efficient adversary can tell

62
00:04:54,091 --> 00:04:57,807
可以区分这两个分布。但不同的是
the difference between these two
distributions. But differently, if an

63
00:04:57,807 --> 00:05:02,077
如果一个攻击者可以区分这两个分布
adversary can distinguish these two
distributions, then we would also give an

64
00:05:02,077 --> 00:05:06,707
我们也可以给出一个对发生器G的攻击
最后，我们最后再做一次
attack on the generator G. And now finally
we're gonna do this one last time. We're

65
00:05:06,707 --> 00:05:11,280
我们用真随机对替换掉这一伪随机对
gonna replace this pseudo random pair by a
truly random pair, and lo and behold we

66
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,672
现在我们获得了我们想要的分布
get the actual distribution that we were
shooting for, we would get a distribution

67
00:05:15,672 --> 00:05:19,851
我们获得了一个由4个独立分组构成的分布
that is really made of four independent
blocks. And so now we have proved this

68
00:05:19,851 --> 00:05:23,279
我们已经证明了这个转换，这两是不可区分的
transition basically that these two
indistinguishable, these two

69
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:27,243
这两是不可区分的，这两是不可区分的
indistinguishable, and these two
indistinguishable, and therefore these two

70
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:31,475
因此这两是不可区分的，记为我们想证明的
are indistinguishable, which is what we
wanted to prove. Okay so this is kind of

71
00:05:31,475 --> 00:05:35,760
这是证明的大致想法，严格证明之并不难
the high level idea for the proof, it is
not too difficult to make this rigorous,

72
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:39,792
不过我只想告诉大家证明的直观想法
but I just wanted to show you kinda
intuition for how the proof works. Well,

73
00:05:39,792 --> 00:05:44,363
如果我们可以扩张发生器的输出
if we were able to extend the generators
outputs once, there's nothing preventing

74
00:05:44,363 --> 00:05:48,822
我们当然可以再做一次，于是就有一发生器G1
us from doing it again so here is a
generator G1 that outputs four elements in

75
00:05:48,822 --> 00:05:53,337
输出密钥空间里的四个元素。记住这里的输出
the key space. And remember the output
here is indistinguishable from our random

76
00:05:53,337 --> 00:05:57,909
与随机四元组不可区分，即为所证
我们完全可以再次应用这个发生器
four tuple, that's what we just proved.
And so there's nothing preventing us from

77
00:05:57,909 --> 00:06:02,480
所以我们会拿着这个发生器，应用于
applying the generator again. So we'll
take the generator apply it to this random

78
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:07,221
这个看起来像是随机的东西。我们应该可以获得
这个看起来像是随机的东西
looking thing and we should be able to get
this random looking thing. This pair over

79
00:06:07,221 --> 00:06:11,511
这对看起来像是随机的。我们可以做同样的事情
here that's random looking. And we can do
the same thing again, and again, and

80
00:06:11,511 --> 00:06:16,405
一次又一次。现在我们也已经构建了一个新的发生器
可以输出K^8里的元素
again. And now basically we've built a new
generator that outputs elements in K to

81
00:06:16,405 --> 00:06:21,261
而不是K^4里的元素，其证明
the eighth, as opposed to K to the fourth.
And again the proof of security is very

82
00:06:21,261 --> 00:06:26,056
也与我刚刚给大家的非常一致
much the same as the one I just showed you
essentially you gradually change the

83
00:06:26,056 --> 00:06:30,612
把输出变成真随机。所以我们把这转变成真随机
outputs into truly random outputs. So we
would change this to a truly random

84
00:06:30,612 --> 00:06:35,168
然后这里，然后那里，然后这里，然后那里，等等
output, then this, then that, then this,
then that and so on and so forth. Until

85
00:06:35,168 --> 00:06:39,724
最终我们获得了真随机的字符串
finally we get something that's truly
random and therefore the original two

86
00:06:39,724 --> 00:06:44,396
所以我们开始用G2K的两个分布
与真随机不可区分。好的
distributions we started with G2K and
truly random are indistinguishable. Okay,

87
00:06:44,396 --> 00:06:49,325
目前还不错。现在我们有一个发生器，输出K^8中元素
so far so good. So now we have a generator
that outputs elements in K to the eighth.

88
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:54,016
如果我们获得了3位PRF，换句话说
Now if we do that basically we get a three
bit PRF. In other words, at zero, zero,

89
00:06:54,016 --> 00:06:58,884
在000处，这个PRF会输出这个分组，等等
zero this PRF would output this block, and
so on and so forth until one, one, one it

90
00:06:58,884 --> 00:07:03,163
直到111它会输出这个分组。现在，有趣的是
would output this block. Now the
interesting thing is that in fact this PRF

91
00:07:03,163 --> 00:07:07,695
事实上这个PRF是容易计算的。例如
假设我们想计算PRF在101处的值
is easy to compute. For example, suppose
we wanted to compute the PRF at the point

92
00:07:07,695 --> 00:07:11,948
好，这是个3位PRF。好，101
one zero one. Okay, it's a three bit PRF.
Okay so one zero one. How would we do

93
00:07:11,948 --> 00:07:16,536
我们该怎么办？我们从这个初始密钥K开始
that? Well basically we would start from
the original key K. And now we would apply

94
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:20,620
现在我们应用发生器G，但我们只关心G输出的右边
the generator G but we would only pay
attention to the right output of G,

95
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:25,040
因为第一位是1。然后我们再次应用发生器
because the first bit is one. And then we
will apply the generator again, but we

96
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:29,516
但我们只关注发生器输出的左边
would only pay attention to the left of
the output of the generator because the

97
00:07:29,516 --> 00:07:33,864
因为第二位是0。然后我们再次应用这个发生器
second bit is zero. And then we would
apply the generator again and only pay

98
00:07:33,864 --> 00:07:38,588
只关注右边，因为第三位是1
attention to the right outputs because the
third bit is one and that would be the

99
00:07:38,588 --> 00:07:43,140
那也是最终输出。好，大家可以看到
这就是101的情况
final output. Right, so you can see that,
that lead us to 101, and in fact because

100
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:47,461
事实上因为整个发生器是伪随机的
the entire generator is pseudo
random, we know that, in particular that,

101
00:07:47,461 --> 00:07:52,796
我们知道这里的输出也是伪随机的。好
这就给了我们一个3位PRF
this output here is pseudo random. Okay,
so this gives us a three bit PRF. Well, if

102
00:07:52,796 --> 00:07:58,632
如果它工作3次，它也完全可以工作N次
it worked three times, there's no reason
why it can't work N times. And so if we

103
00:07:58,632 --> 00:08:03,501
如果我们反复应用这个转换
我们就可以到达GGMPRF
apply this transformation again and again,
we arrive at what's called a GGMPRF. GGM

104
00:08:03,501 --> 00:08:07,956
GGM是指Goldreich, Goldwasser和Micali
stands for Goldreich, Goldwasser and
Micali these are the inventors of

105
00:08:07,956 --> 00:08:12,528
他们是这个PRF的发明者。这个PRF如下工作
this PRF and the way it works is as
follows. So we start off with a generator

106
00:08:12,528 --> 00:08:17,279
我们从将发生器输出扩充一倍开始
我们要构建一个PRF，其定义域很大
just doubles its outputs, and now we're
able to build a PRF that acts on a large

107
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:22,236
为｛0,1｝^N。N可以是128甚至更大
domain mainly a domain of size zero one to
the N, where N could be as big as 128 or even

108
00:08:22,236 --> 00:08:26,897
我们看，假设我们有｛0,1｝^N里的输入
more. So let's see, suppose we're given an
input in 01 to the N, let me show you how

109
00:08:26,897 --> 00:08:31,274
我来展示如何计算这个PRF。现在大家有个好想法
to evaluate the PRF. Well by now you
should actually have a good idea for how

110
00:08:31,274 --> 00:08:35,480
从最初的密钥开始
to do it. Essentially we start from the
original key and then we apply the

111
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:40,255
应用发生器根据X0位来选择左边或右边
generator and we take either the left or
the right side depending on the bit X0 and

112
00:08:40,255 --> 00:08:44,746
然后我们得到了下一密钥K1
我们再次应用发生器
then we arrive at the next key, K1. And
then we apply the generator again and we

113
00:08:44,746 --> 00:08:49,444
根据X1位来选择左边或右边，得到下一个密钥
take the left or the right side depending
on X1 and we arrive at the next key. And

114
00:08:49,444 --> 00:08:54,730
然后我们反复这样操作，直到得到输出
then we do this again and again, until
finally we are arrive at the output. So we

115
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:59,818
我们已经处理了所有位，得到了函数的输出
have processed all end bits, and we arrive
at the output of this function. And

116
00:08:59,818 --> 00:09:05,170
用之前同样的方法，我们可以证明其安全性
basically we can prove security again
pretty much along the same lines as we did

117
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:10,324
我们可以证明如果G是个安全的PRG
before, and we can show that if G is a
secure PRG, then in fact we get a secure

118
00:09:10,324 --> 00:09:14,917
事实上我们可以获得一个安全的PRF
定义在｛0,1｝^N上的，一个非常大的定义域
PRF, on 01 to the N, on a very large
domain. So that's fantastic. Now we have

119
00:09:14,917 --> 00:09:19,064
很神奇。现在我们有一个可证实安全的PRF
we have essential, we have a PRF that's
provably secure, assuming that the

120
00:09:19,064 --> 00:09:23,495
以安全的发生器为前提。这个发生器
underlying generator is secure, and the
generator is supposedly much easier to

121
00:09:23,495 --> 00:09:28,153
比一个实际的PRF更容易构造。事实上
他可以工作的分组可以是很大
build than an actual PRF. And in fact it
works on blocks that can be very large, in

122
00:09:28,153 --> 00:09:33,296
特别地，｛0,1｝^128，这是我们想要的
particular, 01 to the 128th, which is what
we needed. So you might ask well why isn't

123
00:09:33,296 --> 00:09:39,122
大家可能会问，为什么这个在实际中没有被用到？
原因是，它的速度很慢
this thing being used in practice? And the
reason is, that it's actually fairly slow.

124
00:09:39,122 --> 00:09:44,597
设想一下，我们使用Salsa发生器
So imagine we plug in as a generator we
plug in the Salsa generator. So now to

125
00:09:44,597 --> 00:09:50,142
现在来计算这个PRF在某个128位输入的值
我们必须运行Salsa发生器128次
evaluate this PRF at a 128 bit inputs, we
would basically have to run the Salsa

126
00:09:50,142 --> 00:09:55,617
一次只对应一位输入。然后我们获得了
generator 128 times. One time per bit of
the input. But then we would get a PRF

127
00:09:55,617 --> 00:10:01,513
一个PRF，其运行时间却是原版Salsa的128倍
that's 128 times slower than the original
Salsa. And that's much, much, much slower

128
00:10:01,513 --> 00:10:06,227
这比AES慢太多太多。AES是一个启发性的PRF
但它我们这的要快很多
than AES. AES is a heuristic PRF. But
nevertheless it's much faster then what we

129
00:10:06,227 --> 00:10:10,585
尽管这个构造很优雅
just got here. And so even though this is
a very elegant construction, it's not used

130
00:10:10,585 --> 00:10:14,522
实际构造伪随机函数时却不实用
in practice to build pseudo random
functions although in a week we will be

131
00:10:14,522 --> 00:10:18,915
虽然本周我们还有使用这个构造
来构建一个信息完整性的机制
using this type of construction to build a
message integrity mechanism. So the last

132
00:10:18,915 --> 00:10:23,183
最后一步，现在我们构建了一个PRF
step, is basically now that we've built a
PRF, the questions is whether we can

133
00:10:23,183 --> 00:10:27,729
问题是我们能否构建分组密码。换句话说
actually build the block cypher. In other
words, can we actually build a secure PRP

134
00:10:27,729 --> 00:10:32,054
我们能否从一个安全的PRG构建一个安全的PRP呢？
对不可逆的，我们已经解决
from a secure PRG. Everything we've done
so far is not reversible. Again if you

135
00:10:32,054 --> 00:10:36,600
如果大家看这里的构造，给定最后输出
我们是不能解密的
look at this construction here, we can't
decrypt basically given the final outputs.

136
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:40,535
不可能回去，至少我们不知道怎么回去
It is not possible to go back or at least
we don't know how to go back the, the

137
00:10:40,535 --> 00:10:44,520
回到最初的输入。所以现在问题是
original inputs. So now the question of
interest is so can we actually solve the

138
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:48,654
我们能不能解决最初的问题？我们能否
根据安全PRG构建一个分组密码？
problem we wanted solve initially? Mainly,
can we actually build a block cipher from

139
00:10:48,654 --> 00:10:53,540
那么大家想一想，记下答案
a secure PRG? So I'll let you think about
this for a second, and mark the answer. So

140
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:57,718
当然我希望大家的答案是肯定的
of course I hope everyone said the answer
is yes and you already have all the

141
00:10:57,718 --> 00:11:01,896
大家已经万事俱备了。特别地
大家已经知道了如何从一个伪随机数发生器
ingredients to do it. In particular, you
already know how to build a PRF from a

142
00:11:01,896 --> 00:11:06,395
构建一个PRF。我们说了一旦有了PRF
pseudo random generator. And we said that
once we have a PRF we can plug it into the

143
00:11:06,395 --> 00:11:10,573
我们可以使用Luby-Rackoff构造法
记得是一个三回合的Feistel网络
Luby-Rackoff construction, which if you
remember, is just a three-round Feistel.

144
00:11:10,573 --> 00:11:14,750
我们说了如果大家有了安全的PRF
就可以利用三回合Feistel
So we said that if you plug a secure PRF
into a three-round Feistel, you get a

145
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:19,044
就可以得到一个安全的PRP。所以
将两者结合起来，我们就能从一个伪随机数发生器
secure PRP. So combining these two
together, basically gives us a secure PRP

146
00:11:19,044 --> 00:11:23,328
得到一个安全的PRP，它可被证明是安全的
from a pseudo random generator. And this
is provably secure as long as the

147
00:11:23,328 --> 00:11:28,075
只要支持它的发生器是安全的。那么这个
结果很美，但很不幸
underlying generator is secure. So it's a
beautiful result but unfortunately again

148
00:11:28,075 --> 00:11:32,475
它也不实用，因为它比类似于AES的
启发性构造要慢很多
it's not used in practice because it's
considerably slower than heuristics

149
00:11:32,475 --> 00:11:36,725
好，本章完结
constructions like AES. Okay so
this completes our module on constructing

150
00:11:36,725 --> 00:11:40,456
我们构造了伪随机置换和函数
pseudo random permutations, and pseudo
random functions. And then in the next

151
00:11:40,456 --> 00:11:44,287
下一章中我们讨论在正常加密中如何使用它们
module we're gonna talk about how to use
these things to do proper encryption.
