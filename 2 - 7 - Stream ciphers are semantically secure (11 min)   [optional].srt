1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,134
现在我们理解了安全PRG和语义安全
So now that we understand what a secure
PRG is, and we understand what semantic

2
00:00:04,134 --> 00:00:08,425
我们可以证明用安全PRG的流密码
security means, we can actually argue that
a stream cipher with a secure PRG is, in

3
00:00:08,425 --> 00:00:12,559
事实上是语义安全的
这是我们本节的目标
fact, semantically secure. So that's our
goal for this, segment. It's a fairly

4
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:16,746
这是一个很直接的证明，我们会看到怎么做
我们要证明的理论是
straightforward proof, and we'll see how
it goes. So the theory we wanna prove is

5
00:00:16,746 --> 00:00:20,932
给一个安全的发生器G，伪随机发生器
that, basically, given a generator G that
happens to be a secured, pseudo-random

6
00:00:20,932 --> 00:00:24,805
事实上，由这个发生器推出的流密码
generator. In fact, the stream cipher
that's derived from this generator is

7
00:00:24,805 --> 00:00:28,924
将是语义安全的，需要强调
going to be semantically secure. Okay and
I want to emphasize. That there was no

8
00:00:28,924 --> 00:00:33,085
对完美安全，不存在这样的定理
hope of proving a theorem like this for
perfect secrecy. For Shannons concept of

9
00:00:33,085 --> 00:00:37,193
对香农的完美安全，因为我们知道
流密码不可能是完美安全的
perfect secrecy. Because we know that a
stream cipher can not be perfectly

10
00:00:37,193 --> 00:00:41,264
因为它的密钥太短，同时
完美安全要求密钥至少
secure because it has short keys. And
perfect secrecy requires the keys to be as

11
00:00:41,264 --> 00:00:45,321
和明文一样长。那么这是第一个例子
long as the message. So this is really
kind of the first example the we see where

12
00:00:45,321 --> 00:00:49,229
我们看到，可以证明短密钥的密码
也有安全性，即语义安全的概念
we're able to prove that a cipher with
short keys has security. The concept of

13
00:00:49,229 --> 00:00:53,236
这里将证实，这是个非常有用的概念
security is semantic security. And this
actually validates that, really, this is a

14
00:00:53,236 --> 00:00:56,943
事实上，我们将使用语义安全
very useful concept. And in fact, you
know, we'll be using semantic security

15
00:00:56,943 --> 00:01:00,750
很多很多次，贯穿于本课程中。
好，那我们如何证明这么个定理呢？
many, many times throughout the course.
Okay, so how do we prove a theory like

16
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,257
方法是，证明它的逆否命题
this? What we're actually gonna be doing,
is we're gonna be proving the

17
00:01:04,257 --> 00:01:08,264
我们如下进行证明
contrapositive. What we're gonna show is
the following. So we're gonna prove this

18
00:01:08,264 --> 00:01:12,815
我们要证这个命题，让我为大家解读一下
假设有一威胁语义安全的攻击者A
statement down here, but let me parse it
for you. Suppose. You give me a semantic

19
00:01:12,815 --> 00:01:18,345
我们将构造一个PRG攻击者B
security adversary A. What we'll do is
we'll build PRG adversary B to satisfy

20
00:01:18,345 --> 00:01:23,686
以满足这个不等式。
为什么这个不等式有用呢？
this inequality here. Now why is this
inequality useful? Basically what do we

21
00:01:23,686 --> 00:01:28,878
我们知道什么？我们知道如果B
是个有效攻击者，那么
know? We know that if B is an efficient
adversary. Then we know that since G is a

22
00:01:28,878 --> 00:01:33,053
由于发生器G是安全的，我们知道
这个优势是可以忽略的，对吧？
secure generator, we know that this
advantage is negligible, right? A secure

23
00:01:33,053 --> 00:01:37,510
一个安全的发生器对一切有效统计测试
都有可忽略的优势
generator has a negligible advantage
against any efficient statistical test. So

24
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:42,023
所以右边是可忽略的，不过
the right hand side, basically, is gonna
be negligible. But because the right hand

25
00:01:42,023 --> 00:01:46,023
因为右边是可忽略的，我们可以推出
左边也是可忽略的
side is negligible, we can deduce that the
left hand side is negligible.

26
00:01:46,023 --> 00:01:50,767
所以大家看到的攻击者
在攻击流密码E时
And therefore, the adversary that you looked
at actually has negligible advantage in

27
00:01:50,767 --> 00:01:54,538
只有可忽略的优势。好
这就是其中的道理
attacking the stream cipher E. Okay. So
this is how this, this will work.

28
00:01:54,538 --> 00:01:58,486
对任一攻击者A，我们都能构造出
Basically all we have to do is given an
adversary A we're going to build an

29
00:01:58,486 --> 00:02:02,591
一个攻击者B。我们知道攻击者B
对发生器只有可忽略的优势
adversary B. We know that B has negligible
advantage against generator but that

30
00:02:02,591 --> 00:02:06,036
这就意味着A对流密码的优势也是可忽略的
implies that A has negligible advantage against the stream cipher.
(更自然地，若A优势不可忽略，则我们能
构造出B来破解PRG，即PRG不安全)

31
00:02:06,082 --> 00:02:10,994
这么做。给定A，我们只要构造B
So let's do that. So all we have to do again
is given A, we have to build B.

32
00:02:10,994 --> 00:02:15,183
设A为一威胁流密码语义安全的攻击者
So let A be a semantic security adversary against
the stream cipher. So let me remind you

33
00:02:15,183 --> 00:02:19,320
提示一下，这意味着有一挑战者
what that means. Basically, there's a
challenger. The challenger starts off by

34
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:23,509
挑战者选择密钥K，然后攻击者输出两个明文
choosing the key K. And then the adversary
is gonna output two messages, two equal

35
00:02:23,509 --> 00:02:27,383
两个等长的明文M0和M1。
他将收到M0或M1的加密结果
length messages. And he's gonna receive
the encryption of M0 or M1

36
00:02:27,383 --> 00:02:31,226
并输出B1。好，这就是这个攻击者的所做
and outputs B1. Okay, that's
what a semantic security adversary is

37
00:02:31,226 --> 00:02:34,933
那么现在我们开始和这个攻击者玩这个游戏
going to do. So now we're going to start
playing games with this adversary. And

38
00:02:34,933 --> 00:02:38,498
这就是证明我们的引理的方法
that's how we're going to prove our 
lemma. Alright, so the first thing

39
00:02:38,498 --> 00:02:42,535
好，我们第一件事是让挑战者选择随机字符串R
we're going to do is we're going to make
the challenger. Also choose a random R.

40
00:02:42,535 --> 00:02:47,500
好，随机字符串R。攻击者并不关心
Okay, a random string R. So, well you know
the adversary doesn't really care what the

41
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:52,405
挑战者里面是怎么做的。
挑战者不使用R，所以这不影响
challenger does internally. The challenger
never uses R, so this doesn't affect the

42
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:56,365
攻击者的优势。攻击者也不在乎
adversary's advantage at all. The
adversary just doesn't care that the

43
00:02:56,365 --> 00:03:00,706
挑战者也选取了R。这里有个技巧
challenger also picks R. But now comes the
trick. What we're going to do is we're

44
00:03:00,706 --> 00:03:05,042
我们不使用密钥K加密，而是使用R加密
going to, instead of encrypting using key K.
We're going to encrypt using R. You can

45
00:03:05,042 --> 00:03:09,993
可以看到我们是这样做的
see basically what we're doing
here. Essentially we're changing the

46
00:03:09,993 --> 00:03:14,219
我们改变了挑战者，现在挑战者输出的
密文是用一纯随机密码本加密的
challenger so now the challenge
cipher text is encrypted using a

47
00:03:14,219 --> 00:03:19,006
不使用伪随机密码本GK
truly random pad. As opposed to just pseudo
random pad GK. Okay. Now, the property of

48
00:03:19,006 --> 00:03:23,639
这个伪随机数发生器(PRG)的性质是
它的输出与真随机不可区分
the pseudo-random generator is that its
output is indistinguishable from truly

49
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:28,273
因为这个PRG是安全的，攻击者无法分别
random. So, because the PRG is secure, the
adversary can't tell that we made this

50
00:03:28,273 --> 00:03:33,082
其中的不同。攻击者不能判断
我们是否从伪随机字符串切换到了
change. The adversary can't tell that we
switched from a pseudo-random string to a

51
00:03:33,082 --> 00:03:37,422
真随机字符串了。这又是因为
这个发生器是安全的
truly random string. Again, because the 
generator is secure. Well, but now look at

52
00:03:37,422 --> 00:03:41,762
但是现在看我们得到的这个游戏。
攻击者的优势不会改变很多
the game that we ended up with. So the
adversary's advantage couldn't have

53
00:03:41,762 --> 00:03:46,630
因为他不能区分其中的不同，
不过看我们的这个游戏
changed by much, because he can't tell the
difference. But now look at the game that

54
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:51,073
这个游戏是一个一次性密码本的游戏
we ended up with. Now this game is truly a
one time pad game. This a semantic

55
00:03:51,073 --> 00:03:55,803
这是个一次性密码本语义安全的游戏
因为现在攻击者获得了
security game against the one time pad.
Because now the adversary is getting a one

56
00:03:55,803 --> 00:04:00,238
M0和M1的一次性密码本的加密结果
在一次性密码本中
time pad encryption of M0 or M1. But in the
one time pad we know that the adversaries

57
00:04:00,238 --> 00:04:04,048
优势为0，因为一次性密码本无法破解
advantage is zero, because you can't beat
the one time pad. The one time pad is

58
00:04:04,048 --> 00:04:08,165
一次性密码本是无条件地安全的，因此
secure. Unconditionally secure. And as a
result, because of this. Essentially

59
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:12,674
攻击者不能说出
because the adversary couldn't have told
the difference when

60
00:04:12,674 --> 00:04:17,013
这里伪随机和真随机的不同。他不能赢
we moved from pseudo random to random. 
But he couldn't win the random game. 
That also means that he

61
00:04:17,013 --> 00:04:21,411
这也意味着他不能赢下这个伪随机游戏
因此，这个流密码
couldn't win the pseudo random game. And as
a result, the stream cipher, the original

62
00:04:21,411 --> 00:04:25,634
最初的流密码一定是安全的
那就是证明的直观思路
stream cipher must be secure. So that's
the intuition for how the proof is gonna go.

63
00:04:25,634 --> 00:04:29,594
我想再严格地证一遍。现在开始
But I wanna do it rigorously once.
From now on, we're just gonna argue by

64
00:04:29,594 --> 00:04:33,975
我们与挑战者进行游戏
我们今后不会这么形式化
playing games with our challenger. And, we
won't be doing things as formal as I'm

65
00:04:33,975 --> 00:04:38,304
但这一次，我想要精确地、形式化地证明
gonna do next. But I wanna do formally and
precisely once, just so that you see how

66
00:04:38,304 --> 00:04:42,629
这样大家可以看到这些证明的原理
我先引入一些记号
these proofs actually work. Okay, so I'm
gonna have to introduce some notation. And

67
00:04:42,629 --> 00:04:47,751
我用最常见的记号
如果这里最初的语义
I'll do the usual notation, basically. If
the original semantics are here at the

68
00:04:47,751 --> 00:04:52,937
当我们使用伪随机密码本时
我将使用W0和W1
beginning, when we're actually using a
pseudo-random pad, I'm gonna use W0 and W1

69
00:04:52,937 --> 00:04:58,059
来表示攻击者输出1的事件
to denote the event that the adversary
outputs one, when it gets the encryption

70
00:04:58,059 --> 00:05:02,856
在分别加密M0或M1的情况下，好吧？
of M0, or gets the encryption of M1,
respectively. Okay? So W0 corresponds to

71
00:05:02,856 --> 00:05:07,719
W0对应收到M0的密文，输出1
outputting 1 when receiving the
encryption of M0. And W1 corresponds

72
00:05:07,719 --> 00:05:13,141
W1对应收到M1的密文，输出1
to outputting 1 when receiving the 
encryption of M1. So that's the standard

73
00:05:13,141 --> 00:05:19,606
这是语义安全的标准定义
现在我们换到随机密码本
definition of semantic security. Now once
we flip to the random pad. I'm gonna use

74
00:05:19,606 --> 00:05:24,505
我用R0和R1来表示攻击者输出1
R0 and R1 to denote the event that the
adversary outputs 1 when receiving the

75
00:05:24,505 --> 00:05:29,125
在分别加密M0或M1的情况下
one-time pad encryption of M0 or the
one-time pad encryption of M1. So we have

76
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:33,567
所以我们有4个事件: W0，W1
是来自原语义安全游戏的
four events, W0, W1 from the original
semmantics security game, and R0 and R1

77
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:38,365
R0, R1是来自换成一次性密码本的
语义安全游戏
from the semmantics security game once we
switch over to the one-time pad. So now

78
00:05:38,365 --> 00:05:42,985
现在我们看这些变量间的关系
首先，R0和R1是来自
let's look at relations between these
variables. So first of all, R0 and R1 are

79
00:05:42,985 --> 00:05:47,427
换成一次性密码本的语义安全游戏
basically events from a semmantics
security game against a one-time pad. So

80
00:05:47,427 --> 00:05:51,929
我们说了，这些概率间的区别
the difference between these probabilities
is that, as we said, basically the

81
00:05:51,929 --> 00:05:56,902
就是攻击者A的算法的优势
对一次性密码本的
advantage of algorithm A, of adversary A,
against the one-time pad. Which we know is

82
00:05:56,902 --> 00:06:01,231
我们知道优势是0。很好
那就意味着R0的概率等于
zero. Okay, so that's great. So that
basically means that probability of, of R0

83
00:06:01,231 --> 00:06:05,662
R1的概率。现在，我们把这些事件
放在一条线上
is equal to the probability of R1. So now,
let's put these events on a line, on a

84
00:06:05,662 --> 00:06:10,261
这条线将0和1分开.这些是事件
W0和W1是我们感兴趣的事件
line segment between zero and one. So here
are the events. W0 and W1 are the events

85
00:06:10,261 --> 00:06:14,499
我们想证明这俩很接近。好
we're interested in. We wanna show that
these two are close. Okay. And the way

86
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:18,490
方法是。。。哦，应该说
we're going to do it is basically by
showing, oh and I should say, here is

87
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:22,754
这是R0和R1的概率，它们一样
我把它们放在一起
probability R0 and R1, it says
they're both same, I just put them in the

88
00:06:22,754 --> 00:06:27,237
我们要证明W0和W1
same place. What we're gonna do is we're
gonna show that both W0 and W1 are

89
00:06:27,237 --> 00:06:31,720
实际上很接近Rb的概率
从而它们彼此也很接近
actually close to the probability of RB
and as a result they must be close to one

90
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:35,656
好，我们使用第二个论断
another. Okay, so the way we do that is
using a second claim, so now we're

91
00:06:35,656 --> 00:06:39,865
我们对Wb和Rb间的距离感兴趣
interested in the distance between
probability of Wb and the probability of

92
00:06:39,865 --> 00:06:44,730
好，那我待会要证明这个论断
我先表达这个论断
Rb. Okay so we'll prove the claim in a
second. Let me just state the claim. The

93
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:49,938
这个论断是说，存在攻击者B
使得这两个概率的差别
claim says that there exists an adversary
B. Such that the difference of these two

94
00:06:49,938 --> 00:06:55,081
就是B对发生器G的优势
probabilities is basically the advantage
of B against the generator G and this is

95
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:59,833
这对两个b都成立，好吧？
给了这两个论断，定理就证毕了
for both b's. Okay? So given these two
claims, like the theorem is done because

96
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:04,771
因为我们知道这个距离比B对G的优势小
basically what do we know. We know this
distance is less than the advantage of B

97
00:07:04,771 --> 00:07:09,523
那是根据第二个论断的
类似地，这个距离其实
against G. That's from claim two and
similarly, this distance actually is even

98
00:07:09,523 --> 00:07:14,401
甚至等于B对G的优势，
而不是小于它
equal to, I'm not gonna say
less but is equal to the advantage. Of B

99
00:07:14,401 --> 00:07:19,455
因此你可以看到W0和W1的距离
against G, and as a result you can see
that the distance between W0 and W1

100
00:07:19,455 --> 00:07:24,446
最多是B对G的优势的两倍
is basically at most twice the
advantage of B against G. That's basically

101
00:07:24,446 --> 00:07:29,375
这是我们要证明的论断
好的，剩下的工作就是
the thing that we are trying to prove.
Okay the only thing that remains is just

102
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:34,304
证明论断2。如果你想知道论断2的内容
proving this claim two and if you think
about what claim two says, it basically

103
00:07:34,304 --> 00:07:39,170
它抓住了实验0中发生的
captures the question of what happens in
experiment zero what happens when we

104
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:43,530
当我们用真随机R替换伪随机密码本GK
所发生的问题
replace the pseudo random pad GK, by
truly random pad R. Here in

105
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:48,910
在这个实验0中，我们使用伪随机密码本
experiment zero say we're using the pseudo
random pad and here in experiment zero we

106
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:53,593
在这个实验0中，我们使用真随机密码本
我们问攻击者是否能
are using a Truly random pad and we are
asking can the adversary tell the

107
00:07:53,593 --> 00:07:58,972
知道两者的差别。我们说，他不能
difference between these two and we wanna
argue that he cannot because the generator

108
00:07:58,972 --> 00:08:03,845
因为发生器是安全的。好了
这就是我们要做的，来证明论断2
is secure. Okay so here's what we are
gonna do. So let's prove claim two. So we

109
00:08:03,845 --> 00:08:08,728
我们说，事实上有一PRG攻击者B
are gonna argue that in fact there is a
PRG adversary B that has exactly the

110
00:08:08,728 --> 00:08:13,764
他的优势严格地为两概率的差
difference of the two probabilities as
it's advantage. Okay and since the point

111
00:08:13,764 --> 00:08:18,319
好，因为这是可忽略的
is since this is negligible this is
negligible. And that's basically what we

112
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:22,323
是我们想证明的。好
我们看统计测试b
wanted to prove. Okay, so let's look at
the statistical test b. So, what, our

113
00:08:22,323 --> 00:08:26,514
我们的统计测试b将在内部使用攻击者A
statistical test b is gonna use adversary
A in his belly, so we get to build

114
00:08:26,514 --> 00:08:31,091
所以我们按需要构建统计测试b
我们说了，内部使用攻击者A
statistical test b however we want. As we
said, it's gonna use adversary A inside of

115
00:08:31,091 --> 00:08:35,558
这是个常规的统计测试
以n位字符串为输入
it, for its operation, and it's a regular
statistical test, so it takes an n-bit

116
00:08:35,558 --> 00:08:39,694
它要输出判断，随机或不随机
string as inputs, and it's supposed to
output, you know, random or non-random,

117
00:08:39,694 --> 00:08:43,995
0或1。好，我们看看它做的第一件事
zero or one. Okay, so let's see. So it's,
first thing it's gonna do, is it's gonna

118
00:08:43,995 --> 00:08:48,407
运行攻击者A，攻击者A输出两个信息M0和M1
run adversary A, and adversary A is gonna
output two messages, M0 and M1. And then,

119
00:08:48,407 --> 00:08:54,053
然后攻击者b回应
用M0异或输入的字符串
what adversary b's gonna do, is basically
gonna respond with M0 XOR the string that

120
00:08:54,053 --> 00:08:59,942
对吧？然后这是统计测试了
it was given as inputs. Alright? That's
the statistical test, then. Whenever A

121
00:08:59,942 --> 00:09:05,418
无论何时A输出，它就会原封不动地输出
同样结果。现在我们看它的优势
outputs, it's gonna output, its output.
And now let's look at its advantage. So

122
00:09:05,418 --> 00:09:10,477
对这个发生器，这个统计测试的优势
what can we say about the advantage of
this statistical test against the

123
00:09:10,477 --> 00:09:15,606
是多少？根据定义
如果你选择一个真随机字符串
generator? Well, so by definition, it's
the probability that, if you choose a

124
00:09:15,606 --> 00:09:20,527
这里是{0,1}^n
truly random string. So here are 01 
to the N, so probability

125
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:25,587
答案就是B输出1的概率，减去
that R, that B outputs 1 minus the
probability, is that when we choose a

126
00:09:25,587 --> 00:09:32,603
当我们选择伪随机字符串时，
B输出1的概率，对吧？
pseudo random string, B outputs 1, okay?
Okay, but let's think about what this is.

127
00:09:32,603 --> 00:09:37,398
想一想，前面的表达式说明什么？
What can you tell me about the first
expressions? What can you tell me about

128
00:09:37,398 --> 00:09:42,256
这里的表达式说明什么？根据定义
想想这里发生的
this expression over here? Well, by the
definition that's exactly if you think

129
00:09:42,256 --> 00:09:47,366
那严格地是R0的概率，对吧？
about what's going on here, that's this is
exactly the probability R0 right?

130
00:09:47,366 --> 00:09:52,729
因为我们与攻击者玩的这个游戏
Because this game that we are playing with
the adversary here is basically he outputed

131
00:09:52,729 --> 00:09:58,028
这里攻击者输出M0和M1
M0 and M1 right here he outputed 
M0 and M1 and he got the encryption

132
00:09:58,028 --> 00:10:03,919
他获得了真随机一次密码本加密的M0
好，这是一个概率
of M0 under truly one time pad. Okay,
so this is basically a probability. Here

133
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:10,214
让我写得更好一些
那是R0的概率
let me write this a little better. That's
the basically the probability of R0.

134
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:15,467
那下一个表达式什么意思？
Now, what can we say about the next
expression, well what can we say about

135
00:10:15,467 --> 00:10:19,100
当给B输入伪随机字符串Y时
when B is given a pseudo random
string Y as input.

136
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:23,493
这时，这是实验0和真流密码的游戏
Well in that case, this is exactly 
experiment zero and true stream cipher game

137
00:10:23,493 --> 00:10:29,999
因为现在我们要计算M异或M0，异或GK
这严格地为W0
because now we're computing M XOR M0, 
XOR GK. This is exactly W0.

138
00:10:29,999 --> 00:10:33,015
好，那正是我们要证明的
这个证明很简单
Okay, that's exactly what we have to prove. 
So it's kind of a trivial proof.

139
00:10:33,015 --> 00:10:39,563
好，这就完成了论断2的证明
为确保都讲清楚了
Okay, so that completes the proof of claim two. 
And again, just to make sure this is all clear, once we have

140
00:10:39,563 --> 00:10:43,799
我们一旦有了论断2，我们知道W0一定
和W1很接近，即为定理
claim two, we know that W0 must be close
to W1, and that's the theorem.

141
00:10:43,814 --> 00:10:50,383
证毕！好现在我们已经建立了
一个事实上语义安全的流密码
That's what we have to prove. Okay, so now we've
established that a stream cypher is in

142
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:53,880
假定它的PRG是安全的
fact symmantically secure, assuming that
the PRG is secure.
