1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,052
现在我们知道了MAC是什么了
我们继续构建第一类安全的MAC
Now that we know what MACs are, let's go
ahead and build our first secure MACs.

2
00:00:04,052 --> 00:00:08,469
首先我想提醒大家，MAC是一对算法
First I want to remind you that a MAC is a
pair of algorithms. The first is a signing

3
00:00:08,469 --> 00:00:12,922
第一个是签名算法，给定信息和密钥，会产生相应的标签
algorithm that's given a message and a key
will generate a corresponding tag. And the

4
00:00:12,922 --> 00:00:17,103
第二个是验证算法，给定密钥、信息和标签
second is verification algorithms are
given a key, message and a tag while

5
00:00:17,103 --> 00:00:21,736
输出0或1，结果取决于标签是否有效
outputs zero or one depending on whether
the tag is valid or not. And we said that

6
00:00:21,736 --> 00:00:26,313
我们说过MAC是安全的，如果它对选择信息攻击
是不可被存在性伪造的
a MAC is secure if it is existentially
unforgeable under a chosen message attack.

7
00:00:26,313 --> 00:00:30,890
换句话说，攻击者可以实施选择信息攻击
In other words, the attackers allow to
mount a chosen message attack where he can

8
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:35,298
他提交由他选择的任意信息，并获得相应的标签
submit arbitrary messages of his choice
and obtain the corresponding tags for

9
00:00:35,298 --> 00:00:39,520
然后尽管有能力生成任意的标签
those messages, and then despite the
ability to generate arbitrary tags. The

10
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,616
攻击者也不能产生一个新的信息-标签对
attacker cannot create a new message-tag pair that was not given to him

11
00:00:43,616 --> 00:00:47,976
不是选择信息攻击中所给出的信息-标签对
上一节中我们已经看了这个定义
during the chosen message attack. Okay so
we've already seen this definition in the

12
00:00:47,976 --> 00:00:52,179
现在的问题是我们如何构建MAC？
last segment and now the question is how
do we build secure MACs? So the first

13
00:00:52,179 --> 00:00:57,217
我想给大家看的第一个例子是
证明任何安全的PRF可直接
example I want to give you is basically
showing that any secure PRF directly gives

14
00:00:57,217 --> 00:01:01,952
给我们一个安全的MAC。那我们看怎么来做
us a secure MAC as well. So let's see how
we do it. So suppose we have a pseudo

15
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:06,808
假设我们有一个伪随机函数PRF，这个PRF
取输入X，输出Y
random function so the pseudo random
function takes and inputs X and outputs in

16
00:01:06,808 --> 00:01:12,173
我们定义如下的MAC，我们为信息M签名
Y. And let's define the following MAC. So
the way we sign a message 'M' is basically

17
00:01:12,173 --> 00:01:17,182
即为计算函数在M处的值。所以信息M的标签
by simply evaluating the function at the
point 'M'. So the tag for the message M is

18
00:01:17,182 --> 00:01:21,350
就是在点M处的函数值，然后我们通过这一对来验证信息
simply the value of the function at the
point M and then the way we verify a

19
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:26,006
方法就是重新计算在信息M处的函数值
message to that pair is by recomputing the
value of the function at the message M and

20
00:01:26,006 --> 00:01:30,283
检查结果是否等于给我们的标签
如果一样，我们说"是"
checking whether that is equal to the tag
given to us. We say yes if so and we

21
00:01:30,283 --> 00:01:34,681
否则我们拒绝。那么这里有图片描述
reject otherwise. So here you have in
pictures basically that when Alice wants

22
00:01:34,681 --> 00:01:39,023
Alice想给Bob发一条信息，她计算标签
通过计算PRF的值得来
to send a message to Bob, she computes a
tag by the value of PRF and then she

23
00:01:39,023 --> 00:01:43,252
那么她把这个得来的标签附在信息后面
Bob收到了这一对信息
appends this tag to the message, Bob
receives the corresponding tag pair, he

24
00:01:43,252 --> 00:01:47,820
他重新计算函数值，并测试得到的标签
recomputes the value of the function and
tests whether the given tag is actually

25
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:52,730
是否等于在点M处的函数值
那么我们看一个设计得不好的例子
equal to the value of the function at the
point M. So let's look at a bad example of

26
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:57,832
那么假设我们有一个伪随机函数
this instruction. And so suppose that we
have a pseudo-random function that happens

27
00:01:57,832 --> 00:02:02,873
只输出10位，好，这是一个很好的伪随机函数
to output only ten bits. Okay, so this is
a fine pseudo-random function and it just

28
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:07,668
对于任何信息M，它只输出10位
so happens that for any message 'M' it
only outputs ten bits value. My question

29
00:02:07,668 --> 00:02:12,463
我的问题是，如果我们使用这个函数F构建了一个MAC
to you is if we use this function 'F' to
construct a MAC, is that going to be a

30
00:02:12,463 --> 00:02:17,184
得到的MAC是安全的吗？那么答案是否定的
这个MAC是不安全的。特别地
secure MAC? So the answer is no, this MAC
is insecure. In particular because the

31
00:02:17,184 --> 00:02:21,471
是因为标签太短。那么考虑下面这个简单例子
tags are too short. So consider the
following simple adversary. What the

32
00:02:21,471 --> 00:02:26,119
攻击者选择一个任意信息M
adversary will do is simply choose an
arbitrary message M and just guess the

33
00:02:26,119 --> 00:02:30,768
随便猜一个MAC的值，作为这个信息的标签
由于这个标签只有10位
value of the MAC for that particular
message. Now, because the tag is only ten

34
00:02:30,768 --> 00:02:35,175
攻击者有1除以2的10次方的机会猜中MAC
bits long, the adversary has a chance of
one in two to the ten in guessing the MAC

35
00:02:35,175 --> 00:02:40,004
换句话说，攻击者猜测的优势
correctly. In other words, the advantage
of the guessing adversary, one distinctly

36
00:02:40,004 --> 00:02:44,351
给定信息，猜测不同的随机标签
攻击者将有一个
guesses a random tag for a given message.
That adversary is going to have an

37
00:02:44,351 --> 00:02:48,898
对这个MAC的优势就是1除以2的10次方
advantage against the MAC that's basically
one over two to the ten which is one over

38
00:02:48,898 --> 00:02:52,962
即1024分之一，当然不是可忽略的
a thousand twenty four and that's
definitely non negligible. So the adversary

39
00:02:52,962 --> 00:02:57,348
那么攻击者会成功地为给定的信息伪造MAC
basically will successfully forge the MAC
on a given message with probability one

40
00:02:57,348 --> 00:03:01,841
以千分之一的概率，这是不安全的
但事实上这是唯一的会有错误的例子
on a thousand which is insecure. However
it turns out this is the only example that

41
00:03:01,841 --> 00:03:06,280
仅当函数输出太小，事情才会有问题
where things can go wrong, only when the
output of the function is small can things

42
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:10,536
如果这个PRF的输出很大，我们就可以获得一个
这个函数的安全的MAC
go wrong. If the output of the PRF is
large, then we get a secure MAC out of this

43
00:03:10,536 --> 00:03:14,344
我们看一个安全性定理。假设我们有
function. And let's state the security
theorem here. So suppose we have a

44
00:03:14,344 --> 00:03:18,257
一个函数F，取X中的信息为输入，输出Y中的标签
function 'F' that takes messages in 'X'
and outputs tags in 'Y', then the MAC

45
00:03:18,257 --> 00:03:22,588
那么由这个PRF推出的MAC事实上是安全的。特别地
that's derived from this PRF in fact is a
secure MAC. In particular, if you look at

46
00:03:22,588 --> 00:03:26,804
如果大家看这个安全性定理，会很清楚地看到
这个误差上界，换句话说
the security theorem here, you'll see very
clearly the error bounds, in other words

47
00:03:26,804 --> 00:03:31,179
由于PRF是安全的，我们知道这个量是可忽略的
since the PRF is secure we know that this
quantity here is negligible. And so if we

48
00:03:31,179 --> 00:03:35,395
如果我们希望这个量是可忽略的
这是我们想要的，我们想说
want this quantity to be negligible, this
is what we want, we want to say that no

49
00:03:35,395 --> 00:03:39,664
没有攻击者可以击败MAC I_F，意味着
我们希望这个量是可忽略的
adversary can defeat the MAC 'I sub F',
that implies that we want this quantity to

50
00:03:39,664 --> 00:03:43,722
换句话说，我们希望输出空间很大
be negligible, in other words we want the
output space to be large. And so for

51
00:03:43,722 --> 00:03:48,096
例如，取一个PRF，输出80位就很好了
example, taking a PRF that outputs eighty
bits is perfectly fine. That will generate

52
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:52,102
它们会产生80位MAC，因此任意攻击者的优势
an eighty bit MAC and therefore the
advantage of any adversary will be at most

53
00:03:52,102 --> 00:03:56,521
最多是1除以2的80次方。那么这个定理的证明很简单
one over two to the eighty. So now the proof
of this theorem is really simple, so let's

54
00:03:56,521 --> 00:04:00,906
我们来看看，事实上我们不从PRF开始
just go ahead and do it. So in fact let's
start by saying that suppose instead of a

55
00:04:00,906 --> 00:04:05,446
假设我们有一个从信息空间到标签空间的真随机函数
PRF we have a truly random function from
the message space to the tag space so this

56
00:04:05,446 --> 00:04:10,087
这是一个从X到Y的真随机函数
它是从所有函数集中随机选择的
is just a random function from X to Y
that's chosen at random from the set of

57
00:04:10,087 --> 00:04:14,966
我们看这个函数能否给我们一个安全的MAC
all such functions. Now let's see if that
function can give us a secure MAC. So what

58
00:04:14,966 --> 00:04:19,551
那么攻击者说，我想要信息M1的标签
the adversary says is, 'I want a tag on
the message M1'. What he gets back is the

59
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:24,157
他获得了标签，即在点M1处的函数值
tag which just happens to be the function
evaluated at the point M1. Notice there is

60
00:04:24,157 --> 00:04:28,489
注意这里没有密钥，因为F只是一个从X到Y的真随机函数
no key here because F is just a truly
random function from X to Y. And then the

61
00:04:28,489 --> 00:04:33,096
然后攻击者从选择信息M2，他获得了M2的标签
adversary gets to choose a message from M2
and he obtains the tag from M2, he chooses

62
00:04:33,096 --> 00:04:37,264
他选择M3,M4直到Mq，他获得了所有对应的标签
M3, M4 up to MQ and he obtains all the
corresponding tags. Now his goal is to

63
00:04:37,264 --> 00:04:41,432
现在他的目标是产生一个信息标签对
也就说他赢了，记得那就是
produce a message tag pair and we say that
he wins, remember that this is an

64
00:04:41,432 --> 00:04:45,891
存在性伪造，换句话说，首先一定有T=F(M)
existential forgery, in other words first
of all T has to be equal to F of M. This

65
00:04:45,891 --> 00:04:49,968
这意味着T是M的一个有效标签。其次
means that 'T' is a valid tag for the
message 'M'. And second of all, the

66
00:04:49,968 --> 00:04:54,685
信息M必须是新的，信息M不能是M1到Mq中的任何一个
message 'M' has to be new. So the message
'M' had better not be one of M-one to M-Q.

67
00:04:54,685 --> 00:04:58,879
那我们想一想这是什么意思
But let's just think about this for a
minute, what does this mean? So the

68
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:03,830
攻击者看到在点M1到Mq处这个真随机函数的值
adversary got to see the value of a truly
random function at the points M-one to M-Q

69
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:08,800
现在他要预测新点M的函数值
and now he's suppose to predict the value
of this function as some new point, M

70
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,411
但是对于真随机函数，在点M的函数值
However, for a truly random function, the
value of the function at the point M is

71
00:05:13,411 --> 00:05:18,195
与在点M1到Mq处的值是独立的，所以攻击者能做的
independent of its value at the points M-1
to M-Q. So the best the adversary can do

72
00:05:18,195 --> 00:05:22,749
最好的预测点M的函数值，就是猜
at predicting the value of the function at
the point M is just guess the value,

73
00:05:22,749 --> 00:05:27,302
因为他没有任何函数F在M处的值的信息
因此他的优势
because he has no information about F of
M. And as a result his advantage if he

74
00:05:27,302 --> 00:05:31,625
如果他猜在点M处的函数值，他猜中的概率
guesses the value of the function at the
point M he'll guess it right with

75
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:36,294
是1除以|Y|。然后他产生的标签以概率1除以|Y|
probability exactly one over Y. And then
the tag that he produced will be correct

76
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:40,582
是正确的。好，攻击者没有任何信息
with probability exactly one over Y. Okay,
again he had no information about the

77
00:05:40,582 --> 00:05:44,801
是关于函数在M的值，最好的办法就是猜
value of the function of M and so the best
he could do is guess. And if he guesses,

78
00:05:44,801 --> 00:05:49,347
猜的话，他以1除以|Y|的概率猜对。当然
he'll get it right with probability one
over Y. And now of course, because the

79
00:05:49,347 --> 00:05:54,420
因为函数F是伪随机函数，当我们
function capital F is a pseudo random
function, the adversary is gonna behave the

80
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:58,565
给攻击者真随机函数或伪随机函数
攻击者表现是一样的
same whether we give him the truly random
function or the pseudo random function.

81
00:05:58,565 --> 00:06:02,659
攻击者不能说出它们的区别
因此，即使我们有一个伪随机函数
The adversary can't tell the difference
and as a result even if we use a pseudo

82
00:06:02,659 --> 00:06:06,600
攻击者在游戏中获胜的优势最多为1除以|Y|
random function, the adversary is gonna
have advantages at most one over Y in

83
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,774
好，那么大家可以看到这个安全性定理
winning the game. Okay, so you can see
exactly the security theorem, let's go

84
00:06:10,774 --> 00:06:15,561
我们回头看一会。这是为什么我们有这一误差项
back there for just a second. Essentially
this is basically why we got an error term

85
00:06:15,561 --> 00:06:20,005
1除以|Y|，因为是猜测攻击所致，而且猜测
是攻击者为了赢得游戏
of one over Y because of the guessing
attack and that's the only way that the

86
00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:24,734
唯一能做的。那么现在我们知道任何PRF
attacker can win the game. So now that we
know that any secure PRF is also a secure

87
00:06:24,734 --> 00:06:29,122
同时也是安全的MAC，我们已经知道
我们有了第一种MAC的例子。特别地
MAC, we already know that we have our
first example MAC. In particular, we know

88
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:33,680
我们知道AES，或者我们至少相信
AES是一个安全的PRF，因此
that AES, or at least we believe that AES
is a secure PRF, therefore, AES since it

89
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,011
由于AES取16字节的输入，AES的信息空间是128位
takes sixteen byte inputs, right the
message space for AES is 128 bits, which

90
00:06:38,011 --> 00:06:43,212
即16字节。因此AES加密会给我们一个MAC
is sixteen bytes. Therefore the AES cipher
essentially gives us a MAC that can match

91
00:06:43,212 --> 00:06:48,140
匹配严格的16字节信息。好的，这是我们的第一个MAC例子
messages that are exactly sixteen bytes.
Okay, so that's our first example of a

92
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:53,257
现在问题是，如果我们有了一个PRF
针对像AES这样的小输入，仅16字节的
MAC. But now the question is if we have a
PRF for small inputs like AES that only

93
00:06:53,257 --> 00:06:58,564
那么我们能不能为长信息也构建一个MAC呢？
acts on sixteen bytes, can we build a MAC
for big messages that can act on gigabytes

94
00:06:58,564 --> 00:07:02,066
比如几个G的数据呢？有时我把这个称之为麦当劳问题
of data? Sometimes I call this the
McDonald's problem. Basically given a

95
00:07:02,066 --> 00:07:05,871
给一个小的MAC，我们构建它的一个大MAC
换句话说，给定短信息的MAC
small MAC and we build a big MAC out of
it. In other words, given a MAC for small

96
00:07:05,871 --> 00:07:10,234
我们构建长信息的MAC。我们看两个这样的机制
messages and we build a MAC for large
messages. So we're gonna look at two

97
00:07:10,234 --> 00:07:14,835
第一个例子叫做CBC MAC
constructions for doing so. The first
example is called a CBC MAC that again

98
00:07:14,835 --> 00:07:19,315
取针对短信息的PRF为输入
输出一个PRF，可以处理长信息
takes PRF for small messages as input
and produces a PRF for very large

99
00:07:19,315 --> 00:07:23,686
作为输出。第二个我们要看的机制是HMAC
它做到事情是一样的
messages. As outputs. The second one we'll
see is HMAC which does the same thing

100
00:07:23,686 --> 00:07:28,278
取处理短输入的PRF，产生能处理长输入的PRF
again takes a PRF for small inputs and
generates a PRF for very large inputs. Now

101
00:07:28,278 --> 00:07:32,050
现在这两个被用在了不同的上下文中
the two are used in very different
contexts. CBC-MAC is actually very

102
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:36,315
CBC-MAC在银行业广为应用
例如有一个系统叫做
commonly used in the banking industry. For
example, there's a system called the

103
00:07:36,315 --> 00:07:40,797
自动打扫房间ACH，银行使用这个系统来处理
银行之间的支票
Automatic Clearing House, ACH, which banks
use to clear checks with one another and

104
00:07:40,797 --> 00:07:44,788
CBC-MAC被用来确保支票的完整性
that system, CBC-MAC, is used to ensure
integrity of the checks as they're

105
00:07:44,788 --> 00:07:49,107
支票是在银行之间传递的。在因特网上
SSL、IPsec和SSH等协议
transferred from bank to bank. On the
Internet, protocols like SSL and IPsec and

106
00:07:49,107 --> 00:07:53,173
都使用HMAC来保护完整性。这两个不同的MAC
SSH, those all use HMAC for integrity. Two
different MACs and were gonna discuss them

107
00:07:53,173 --> 00:07:57,086
我们将在下面几节中讨论它们
如我所说，从处理短信息的PRF出发
in the next couple of segments. And as I
said were also gonna start from a PRF for

108
00:07:57,086 --> 00:08:01,274
产生能够处理几个G的信息的PRF
small messages and produce PRF for
messages that are gigabytes long and in

109
00:08:01,274 --> 00:08:06,043
特别地，它们两种MAC都可以用AES作为底层密码
particular they can both be substantiated
with AES as the underlying cipher. So the

110
00:08:06,043 --> 00:08:10,597
那么我最后想说的，关于这些基于PRF的MAC的
last comment I want to make about these
PRF based MACs is that in fact their

111
00:08:10,597 --> 00:08:15,269
事实上它们的输出是可以被截断的
假设我们有一个PRF，输出N位
output can be truncated. So suppose we
have a PRF that outputs N bit outputs. So

112
00:08:15,269 --> 00:08:19,941
对于AES，这是一个输出128位的PRF
again for AES this would be a PRF that
outputs 128 bits as outputs. It's an easy

113
00:08:19,941 --> 00:08:24,909
这是一个容易证明的引理。事实上如果你有一个
N位PRF，如果你截断之，换句话说
lemma to show that in fact if you have an
N bit PRF if you truncated, in other words

114
00:08:24,909 --> 00:08:31,062
如果你值输出前K位，结果依然是安全的PRF
if you only output first K bits, the
result is also a secure PRF and the

115
00:08:31,062 --> 00:08:36,529
直观地说，如果大PRF对任意输入，都能
输出N位随机字符串
intuition here is if the big PRF outputs N
bits of randomness for any inputs that you

116
00:08:36,529 --> 00:08:42,059
那么把结果截断成T位后
give to the PRF then certainly chopping it
off and truncating it to T bits is still

117
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:46,572
看上去依然是随机的。攻击者获得更少的信息
gonna look random. The attacker now gets
less information so his job of

118
00:08:46,572 --> 00:08:51,657
所以他区分随机输出的工作会更困难。换句话说
distinguishing the outputs from random
just became harder. In other words, if the

119
00:08:51,657 --> 00:08:56,742
如果N位PRF是安全的，那么T(<N)位PRF，截断PRF
N bit PRF is secure, then the T less than
N bit PRF, the truncated PRF, would also

120
00:08:56,742 --> 00:09:01,177
也是安全的。这是一个简单的引理，由于任何安全PRF
be secure. So this is an easy lemma and
since any secure PRF also gives us a

121
00:09:01,177 --> 00:09:05,993
也能给我们一个安全的MAC，这意味着如果你给我
一个基于PRF的MAC
secure MAC, what this means is if you give
me a MAC that's based on a PRF and what I

122
00:09:05,993 --> 00:09:10,686
我可以把它截断成W位，但是，因为
基于PRF的MAC的定理中的误差项
can do is I can truncate it to W bits,
however, because of the error term in the

123
00:09:10,864 --> 00:09:15,379
我们知道截断到W位是安全的
MAC based PRF theorem we know that
truncating to W bits will only be secure

124
00:09:15,379 --> 00:09:19,954
只要1除以2的|W|次方是可忽略的
那么如果你截断PRF到只有3位
as long as one over two to the W is
negligible. So if you truncate the PRF to

125
00:09:19,954 --> 00:09:24,410
那么得到的MAC就不是安全的。不过
only three bits, the resulting MAC is not
going to be secure. However, if you

126
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:29,222
如果你把它截断成80位，甚至是64位
那么得到的MAC也是
truncate it to say 80 bits or maybe even
64 bits, then the resulting MAC is still

127
00:09:29,222 --> 00:09:33,974
一个安全的MAC。好，需要记住的事情是
gonna be a secure MAC. Okay, so the thing
to remember here is that even though we

128
00:09:33,974 --> 00:09:39,235
即使我们使用AES来构建更大的PRF
最后PRF的输出将是128位
use AES to construct larger PRFs and the
output of these PRFs is gonna be 128 bits,

129
00:09:39,235 --> 00:09:44,115
这并不意味着MAC自身必须产生128位标签
it doesn't mean that the MAC itself has to
produce 128 bit tags. We can always

130
00:09:44,115 --> 00:09:48,550
我们总可以把结果截断成90位或80位
因此，我们依然可以得到
truncate the outputs to 90 bits or 80
bits, and as a result, we would get still

131
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:53,097
安全的MAC，但现在输出标签有着更合理的大小
secure MACs but now the output tag is
gonna be more reasonable size and doesn't

132
00:09:53,097 --> 00:09:57,702
不必是满满的128位。好，在下一节中
have to be the full 128 bits. Okay, so in
the next segment we're gonna look at how

133
00:09:57,702 --> 00:09:58,726
我们看CBC-MAC的工作
the CBC-MAC works.
